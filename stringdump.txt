At last, you are asleep.
string 1
For three nights, each attempt to sleep has brought you starting from your bed in fright, with no memory of what horrified you so.
string 2
With a sickening sense of deja vu, you begin to dream.
string 3
You try to wake, but tonight the ghostly eyes captivate you.
string 4
``Treachery and doom!''
string 5
``My brother would unleash a great evil upon us.''
string 6
``Britannia is in peril!''
string 7
Sure that the ghost can take you to Britannia, you allow yourself to be drawn to him.
string 8
``Aaaaaaaaaaah!''
string 9
``A visitor from far away indeed.''
string 10
``I'd suspect my brother sent thee, were he alive.''
string 11
``Still, thou shalt draw the hounds from the scent.''
string 12
Below, a creature heads toward the dark woods, a thrashing sack slung over its massive shoulder.
string 13
``What hast thou done with our lord's daughter Arial?''
string 14
``Dropped her below to an accomplice, I'll wager.''
string 15
``Well, he'll nay escape us. And when we bring 'im back, you'll both hang!''
string 16
Several tense hours later, you are dragged before Baron Almric.
string 17
Ignoring you, Almric questions his captain.
string 18
``What news, Corwin?''
string 19
``Forgive us, milord.''
string 20
``The foul creature escaped.''
string 21
``A score of us gave chase, but it fled into the Stygian Abyss with poor Arial.''
string 22
``We were attacked_._._. Goblins and worse, milord.''
string 23
``Only three of us survived!''
string 24
``I see.''
string 25
The baron turns his piercing blue eyes upon you.
string 26
``I was warned of thy coming.''
string 27
``Last fortnight, an apparition of an old, haggard man appeared in my dreams.''
string 28
``^`Guard thy daughter well,' it warned. `For an evil one shall come to steal her away.'^''
string 29
``I posted guards at Arial's door, but still you took her from me!''
string 30
``They say thou didst drop her to a Troll waiting below. What sayest thou?''
string 31
You explain that you are the Avatar and that you are innocent.
string 32
``Whether thou speak truth or falsehood I cannot say.''
string 33
``Stories tell of the comings of the Avatar, but years have passed since he visited here.''
string 34
``If thou art truly the Avatar, then perhaps thou canst offer hope.''
string 35
``None here can survive the Abyss and rescue Arial.''
string 36
``My mind is set. Corwin shall take thee to the Abyss.''
string 37
``Return here with my daughter, and thy innocence shall be proven.''
string 38
``If thou dost not return, `Avatar,' thy lies shall have brought thee low.''
string 39
``This be the foul pit's only entrance. Once it is locked, none can pass.''
string 40
``I will shut thee in and stand guard until Arial's voice do I hear from within.''
string 41
``Otherwise, 'twill remain shut forever.''

You dash down the mountainside toward the sea, mere steps ahead of the lava.
string 1
Diving into the ocean, you make for a lone boat.
string 2
You are helped aboard by the guards' captain Corwin! It is the Baron's vessel.
string 3
``Thou hast earned my gratitude, and more.''
string 4
``Were it not for thee, my daughter tells me we would have lost more than her delightful company.''
string 5
``Truly, I was a fool for doubting thee. Canst thou forgive a worried father?''
string 6
``Thou art the greatest hero ever to come to Britannia!''
string 7
``When I returned to the surface using the Amulet of Travel and warned my father, we thought all was lost.''
string 8
``Thou hast accomplished what none else could, and saved our land!
string 9
Swiftly, the ship sails away from the wreckage of Cabirus' dreams.
string 10
At last, you are asleep.
string 11
For the last three nights, since your triumphant return home, you have been too excited to sleep.
string 12
Just as you are drifting off, Garamon appears.
string 13
``Hail to thee, Avatar! Thou hast well earned thy rest!''
string 14
``I wish to thank thee for saving Britannia and repairing my brother's disastrous mistake.''
string 15
``I regret that I was not able to help thee flee the island_._._.''
string 16
``._._._but I was marshalling my last powers to open a gate for the inhabitants of the Abyss.''
string 17
``They are now settling in a place called Destard.''
string 18
``Farewell, and may Britannia never again be in such need of thy aid.''

Hast thou come to add to my torment?
string 2
Of what torment dost thou speak?
string 3
Of course not.  If I may, I shall ease thy pain.
string 4
If my presence offends thee, I shall go.
string 5
Indeed I have, thou mewling child!
string 6
Why, the torment of lost hopes... Of disillusionment.
string 7
Tell me more.
string 8
Oh, is that all?
string 9
Can I help?
string 10
I shall leave thee to thy grief if thou wish it so.
string 11
I shared the great dream of Sir Cabirus, that the Avatar's way could be pursued by all folk.  We sought to gather all intelligent species here in the Abyss and teach them to live in harmony.  Alas, it was not to be.
 The constant bickering proved too much for kindly Sir Cabirus, and he perished in his sleep.  Some said he was poisoned, but I know he died of a broken spirit.
 His life's work was in this place, and as he watched it crumble, his heart broke as well.
string 12
I am sorry to hear that.  Does aught remain of his dream?
string 13
A terrible waste.  Did nothing good come of it?
string 14
He was a fool!
string 15
Well, aye, Sir Cabirus did gather a number of artifacts with interesting properties. He thought the use of these artifacts might assist the colonists as they pursued the way of the Avatar. Unfortunately, the objects were misused by the folk he hoped to help.
string 16
How so?
string 17
I am sorry to hear that
string 18
Wouldst rather be alone?
string 19
Each of the eight items gathered by Sir Cabirus embodied one of the Virtues. But those who now possess the items keep them merely for their intrinsic value, not their higher purpose.
string 20
Such a fool was this Cabirus!
string 21
A pity, but nothing can be done about it now.
string 22
Then I shall find these artifacts and put them to proper use.
string 23
Thou dare to profane his memory!  Begone with thee!
string 24
Hast thou returned to torment me further?
string 25
If my presence offends thee, I shall go.
string 26
Indeed I have, thou mewling child!
string 27
Get thee from my sight!
string 28
Nay.  I can help thee now.
string 29
Hast thou indeed found a way to help?
string 30
Aye.  But thou must tell me of Sir Cabirus.
string 31
Get thee from my sight!
string 32
Nay.  I cannot help thee.
string 33
Is that all thou hast to say?  Get thee gone from here!
string 34
Goodbye.
string 35
Get from here thyself!
string 36
No, wait.  I can help!
string 37
Wait!  My cause is lost, but perhaps I can yet help thee.
string 38
Canst tell me of Sir Cabirus?
string 39
My thanks, but thou hast done enough.
string 40
Well, I am beyond thy help!
string 41
Oh?  Well, fare thee well.
string 42
Indeed thou art.
string 43
Nay.  None are truly hopeless.
string 44
Art thou certain thou dost wish to hear my sorry tale again?
string 45
Ah, no, what was I thinking?
string 46
Certainly.  It bears retelling!

I need some information.

What dost thou know of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?

Where might I find a good weaponsmith?

Canst thou teach me to repair items myself?

Well, there's no substitute for practice, but I've heard tell that the mantra LON may help ye to repair items with more skill.  Now, can I do anything else for ye?
string 9
This is in need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?
string 10
Canst thou tell me what this is?
string 11
Dost know aught of Cabirus' Talismans?

If it's smithing ye need, ye have come to the right man.  But my services are nae cheap.  Can ye pay?

Aye, 'tis a fine sword there, @SS1.  I'm afraid it's  seen better days, though.  Dinna fear, I'll make it whole for ye again. But I must charge ye 20 gold pieces for such fine work, paid when you pick it up.
string 19
Not yet, I have something else to do first.
string 20
Very well.  Here it is.
string 21
Ach, ye're wastin' me time
string 22
Ach, do I look like I have four arms? I can only fix one thing at a time, you know. 
string 23
Well, I'm afraid this has seen its last fight. 'Tisn't even worth trying to fix.
string 24
Ah, looks like 'tis half of the Sword Caliburn. Nothing I can do to it without its other half, though!
string 25
Ach, what do I look like?  This be a smithy, not a trinket shop.  Weapons and armor, that's my work!
string 26
Ah, ye'll not be bringing me trash like that to fix,  will ye?  'Tisn't worthy of me time.  Look a' it!  S'worthless!  Goblin-work,  no doubt.  No, ye'll be wanting a new one, I'm sure.
string 27
Ah! This @SS2 is in perfect condition!  There's nothin' I can do for ye.

Very well.  I shall return.

Little enough o' most, but I ken well that two o' them were smith-work.  A sword and a shield they were, both fine work.
string 50
Tell me of this Sword.
string 51
Tell me of this Shield.
string 52
The Shield of Valor, it were named.  Never a finer one did I see.  'Twas Blackthorne's once, or so I've 'eard tell.  But it were one o' those things easier to set aside than to take up again, an' he left it when he went to become the conscience for all the world.  Ach, but that were a mess.  Be there aught else I can do for ye?

Dost know where the Shield is now?
string 54
Tell me about the Sword.
string 55
No, thank you.
string 56
Aye, now there was a weapon!  Willful, they say, but potent beyond mortal blades.  It had a sense of fair play, did Caliburn.  'Twasn't for naught they called it the Sword o' Justice.  'Twas forged by the great Flamebeard himself.  Would there be anythin' else, then?
string 57
Dost know where the Sword lies?
string 58
No, I do not.  Broken into two pieces, I hear it was, but where they are I canna tell ye.
string 59
No, thank you.
string 60
Well, ye can see it yourself, now that I've fixed it for ye.  A fine blade, is she not?  'Twill serve ye well, if ye're careful to use it in a just cause.  Be there anything else I can do for ye?
string 61
This is in need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?

Canst thou tell me what this is?

That's it all right, the Shield of Valor itself.  Lucky ye are to have found it.  Never a better shield was there fashioned, to my knowledge.  Can I help ye further?
string 68
That's no Shield of Valor I see!
string 69
Ah, is this it?
string 70
I have not found it, then.
string 71
Well, don't ye give up hope.  If 'twere made, 'twill be found.  Now, is there anything else?
string 72
This is need of repair.  Canst thou repair it?
string 73
Canst thou tell me what this is?
string 74
No, but I thank thee for thy help.
string 75
Aye, I suppose ye're right.  Perhaps ye might be able to find some valuables lying around somewhere.
string 76
Very well.  I shall try it.

Thanks, but I shall look elsewhere.

Do ye want the sword fixed or not?

Greetings, Traveller.  I am Goldthirst, leader of the Mountain-folk.  Welcome to our hall.
string 2
Well met, Lord Goldthirst.
string 3
Thank thee, O Dwarf-King.
string 4
Greetings, your Majesty.
string 5
Majesty, is it?  Well, thou art good at flattery, if nothing else!
string 6
It would be difficult to flatter one so noble as thee, your Majesty.
string 7
I beg thy pardon.  I did not intend to insult thy intelligence with flattery.
string 8
Thou hast a fine tongue, and a sense of courtesy.  Hast thou other Virtues as well?
string 9
I am a paragon, embodying every Virtue, my Lord.
string 10
None worth mentioning, milord.
string 11
Call me that again, and thy tongue shall wag without thy head around it!
string 12
That is quite enough.  Hast thou some reason for coming here?
string 13
I would see thy hoard.
string 14
I am in search of adventure.
string 15
I bring thee this gift.
string 16
Thou shalt see it for thyself!  Take thee to the end of the hall from which thou didst enter and say the words "Deco Morono" to the guard at the door.
string 17
I thank thee.
string 18
Thou art truly a noble dwarf.
string 19
Well!  Thou art aware that it is customary to offer a gift when granted an audience?
string 20
No, I was not, my lord.  I have nothing worthy here.
string 21
Indeed.  Here is thy gift.
string 22
Ah, but I am giving thee the blessing of my company!
string 23
My apologies. We have different customs where I come from.
string 24
That's quite all right.  Nothing fancy is needed, just a token.  A little . . . GOLD will do.
string 25
Here is thy gift.
string 26
Nay, I spoke truly.  I have nothing to give.
string 27
No, I cannot help thee with that.
string 28
Is there some other way I can help thee?
string 29
Thou canst not toy with me!
string 30
But thou art empty handed! Dost thou really wish to give me a gift?
string 31
Yes, I'm sorry, here it is...
string 32
No, I have no gift worthy of thee.
string 33
This is indeed a goodly gift, and I thank thee for it most kindly.  Wouldst care to see the treasure chamber to which it will be added?
string 34
Oh, yes, very much!
string 35
No, but I thank thee.
string 36
Only if your lordship insists.
string 37
It will do, I suppose.  Thou mayst go now.
string 38
Ungrateful wretch!  A pox on thee and thy greed!
string 39
Thy graciousness is overwhelming.  Good-day.
string 40
Indeed, I suppose thou wouldst.  Many should like to see my treasure . . .  touch it, stroke it, perhaps STEAL it!  That is what thou wouldst like, isn't it? To rob me blind after I was foolist enough to invite thee here!
 GUARDS!  GUARDS!  ARREST THIS THIEF!
string 41
'Twas not my intent to upset thee.  Call off thy guards. I will leave.
string 42
You'll never take @GS8 alive!
string 43
Well then.  What is the reason for thy visit?
string 44
I bring thee this gift.
string 45
I am seeking adventure.
string 46
Merely to meet thee.
string 47
Perhaps we can help each other . . . I have need of such an adventurer as thyself.  Our mines have been invaded by a terrible monster!
string 48
Indeed?  Perhaps I can help!
string 49
That is too bad.  Good day to thee.
string 50
I believe that I have slain the beast already.
string 51
That is well.  I have need of a paragon, just now.  Art thou aware that my people's mine has been invaded by a monster?
string 52
Indeed?  Perhaps I can help!
string 53
That is too bad.  A good day to thee.
string 54
I believe that I have slain the beast already.
string 55
Excellent!  A hero at last. My people, at least those not too valuable to lose, are all too afraid of the beast to dare face it!  It is a fearsome beast, covered with tentacles and with many eyes.  If thou art brave enough, and you slay the creature, I shall reward thee handsomely!
string 56
It shall be done!
string 57
We shall see.
string 58
I knew thou wert a hero!  Was it difficult?
string 59
Extraordinarily so.  None but I could have succeeded.
string 60
Yes.  I was fortunate to have slain it.
string 61
We are then fortunate that thou wert the one to undertake the task. Thou hast our thanks.  Was there anything else?
string 62
I pray thee, accept this humble gift.
string 63
Thou art most welcome.  Farewell.
string 64
And modest as well!  Truly, thou art worthy of this great reward!  Here!
string 65
A small, stooped member of the race of Mountain-folk scuttles forward, presenting to you a small amulet cast in the shape of a stone-cutter's chisel.\m
string 66
This was the favored tool of Great Coulnes, the best gemcutter ever to grace our tribe.  It is traditionally presented to heroes and those who excel in their craft.  Thou art the first not of our folk to bear it.  May it bring thee fortune.  Again, our thanks.
string 67
\mI will leave it here for ye.
string 68
Thou art welcome.  Accept this gift in return.
string 69
I thank thee.  Farewell.
string 70
Greetings, bold @GS8.  Hast thou managed to kill the vicious monster infesting our mines?
string 71
Yes, the deed has been done.
string 72
No, it has still eluded me.
string 73
I have been busy with other quests.
string 74
Ah, @GS8!  It is a pleasure to see thee again.  Thy name shall go down in the history of our clan!
string 75
And rightfully so.
string 76
I do not deserve such praise.
string 77
I thank thee.  Here is a gift for you.
string 78
Well, we are glad that thou hast visited us.  Do say hello again when thou art in the vicinity.  Thy company is always welcome.
string 79
Oh, pish.  Thou bearest the amulet of Coulnes, a testament to thy heroics.  As long as this clan lives, we shall remember thee.
string 80
Thou art humble as well as brave!  Surely thou deservest a reward.
string 81
Hm.  Perhaps thou art not so great a warrior as I first suspected.
string 82
Thou may be right.
string 83
I will do my best to vanquish the beast.
string 84
Oh, 'tis thee again.  Is there a reason for thy visit?
string 85
Greetings, bold @GS8.  What brings thee back to our hall?
string 86
I have a gift for your Lordship.  I trust it pleases thee.
string 87
I have another gift for your Lordship.
string 88
I am in search of adventure.
string 89
I merely wished to pay my respects, your Lordship.  I must be going.
string 90
Thou canst not toy with me!
string 91
But thou art empty handed! Dost thou really wish to give me a gift?
string 92
Yes, I'm sorry, here it is...
string 93
No, I have no gift worthy of thee.
string 94
'Tis a fine gift.  I thank thee kindly.
string 95
Thou art welcome.  Farewell.
string 96
I am glad thou dost enjoy it.
string 97
Zounds!  A larger lump of gold I have never seen!  Surely thou art deserving of this axe, an honored weapon that has been passed down from the time of my ancestors.  Use it well, for there are few weapons better.

Ghouls used to live in tombs, lots of food there. After big collapse, crazy wizard come here,  talking 'bout justice. He throw us out of tombs.  Said ghouls no care about justice so we no could live there anymore. He put part of sword in tombs too, I think.

I would not expect thee to be a musician.
string 24
Yeah, me musician.  You surprised Ghoul can be musician?  Me musician before me Ghoul.  Me play in state hall for Cabirus all the time.
string 25
What didst thou play for Cabirus?
string 26
I'm sure thou didst play wonderfully.
string 27
It was great.  Me play all kinds stuff.  Me play "Mardin's Song of Wonder" lot of times.  Was Cabirus' favorite spiritual.  Said that you play it in the right place, wondrous thing happen.  But no one know place.
string 28
Really?  How did it go?
string 29
I'd like to try to play it.
string 30
You got flute?  Me teach song to you.
string 31
Yes, in fact I do.
string 32
No, I do not.
string 33
Okay, let me see flute.
string 34
Here it is.
string 35
Oh, sorry.  I don't have one.
string 36
Hey, me no see flute.
string 37
This flute should work fine.  Notes of tune are 3 5 4 2 3 7 8 7 5.
string 38
I shall be sure to practice it.
string 39
Thank thee, Eyesnack.
string 40
Okay, get flute and me teach you song.
string 41
Whole floor of Abyss was used for meetings.  Was state hall, tombs, meeting rooms.  No one lived here, just came for meetings.  After collapse, meetings stop and people no come here.
string 42
What was this particular area?
string 43
Why do the ghouls live here now?
string 44
When collapse happen, food get scarce fast.  Bunch of us who work here before collapse live off bodies in tombs. Start to like them better than other food.  Other humans call us ghouls.  Pretty soon we call selves Ghouls.  Later we kicked out of tombs, move here.
string 45
What was thy job here before the collapse?
string 46
Who kicked thee out of the tombs?
string 47
Some wizard.  Me no remember for sure.  Shanklick, leader of Ghouls, know about wizard. Ask her.
string 48
What was thy job here before the collapse?
string 49
I shall ask her, then.  Farewell.

string 54
Er...I see.  Didst thou say something about humans?
string 55
Sounds delicious.
string 56
Hey, you okay for human!  Most complain about Ghouls, say they evil for eating guys.  Me think they just jealous because we no hungry all time like them.
string 57
What were things like here before the collapse?
string 58
Me see humans here long time ago before collapse.  Before Ghouls even exist.  We all just humans then.
string 59
What did humans do here before the collapse?
string 60
What dost thou mean, before Ghouls exist?
string 61
You rotten live human.  Me no talk to you.

string 27

string 28
Well, canst thou tell me aught of the Abyss?
string 29
My enemies are legion.  Even the vermin here are troublesome.  A great she-spider, known as Navrey Night-eyes, threatens my folk.  Nor is she my only problem, though she is enough.  Her web, ye know, be strong as iron, and does not burn.  A Goblin caught in it will stay 'till he rots!
string 30
Terrible!
string 31
Perhaps I can help.
string 32
Do not be a fool!  None can slay the dread Navrey!  Now, ye came here for something.
string 33
I be Ketchaval, the mighty leader of the last holding of the noble Goblins, the Gray tribe.
 Years ago, when we were lured here by that sweet-talking fool, Cabirus, we noble Grays brought with us our servants, the lowly and ignorant Green Goblins, to care for us in our new homes.\m
string 34
We later granted them their freedom, and equal citizenship, though all knew we did them more honor than they were worth.  And see how they rewarded us!  They split off when Cabirus' "civilization" fell, and have opposed us ever since.
 Only my leadership has kept us together in the face of such opposition.
string 35
Such a job must have many cares.
string 36
Have the Greens no redeeming value?
string 37
I am glad for thee.  Farewell.
string 38
None whatever!  They are distrusting, vindictive, and calculating.  But enough of them!
string 39
What d'ye want?
string 40
I need to find a girl.
string 41
I seek knowledge of Cabirus.
string 42
Thou hast helped me already.  I thank thee.  I must be going.
string 43
A human fool named Cabirus convinced many of our people to come here and colonize this accursed place.  When his dreams were shown to be mere folly, he killed himself -- by taking poison -- and left us to our fates.
string 44
Tragic!
string 45
Ah, well, I must be going now.  Goodbye!
string 46
Indeed, 'tis not fair!  Still, we must persevere.  Was there anything else?
string 47
No.  I thank thee.  Farewell.
string 48
I need to find a girl.
string 49
I seek knowledge of Cabirus.

I have quested long to drink from the fountain of thy wisdom, O pearl among kings.

True!  I AM rather wise, come to think of it.  What dost thou wish to know?
string 12
Who was Sir Cabirus?
string 13
What are these Talismans of which I hear?
string 14
Tell me of the races of the Abyss.
string 15
How came you by that gorgeous cloak?

Well... Perhaps thou canst be forgiven.  This place IS full of the most frightfully rude people.  Thou mayst remain.  What is thy need?
string 17
Merely to partake in some small manner of thy vast knowledge.
string 18
Nothing.  I'm leaving.
string 19
I require some information.
string 20
I've changed my mind about thee!  Thou art indeed a ruffian!  Get thee hence!
string 21
Thou hast the manners of an acid slug!  Get out of here!
string 22
Thou art entirely too generous with thy time!
string 23
Perhaps thou couldst stand a little further downwind?
string 24
I do most humbly crave thy pardon.
string 25
Thou art a dandified fool!
string 26
It does suit me, doesn't it?  I had it made especially for me.  One simply doesn't find work like this underground.
 Well, perhaps the Mountain-folk do make a few nice things, but they tend toward metals rather than clothes.
 And of course the Seers -- the Ancient Illuminated Seers of the Moonstone, they call themselves -- they do nice work, too.  But they generally tend more toward the literary than the sartorial arts.
string 27
Who was Sir Cabirus?
string 28
What are these Talismans of which I hear?
string 29
What are the power groups within the Abyss?
string 30
And this hall?  It is most beautiful.
string 31
Well, one does what one can.  Of course those awful Gray Goblins took all the really nice things with them when they stole away in the night -- this was just after Sir Cabirus died, you know, when things were falling apart -- and we've had to make do since then.
 One of these days I'm going to get some poison into Ketchaval or his ugly wife (which amounts to the same thing -- he's terribly henpecked, you know), and then we'll see what's what.  King of the Gray Goblins, indeed.\m
string 32
Why he's an upstart!  His father was a horse-thief! But enough of this ... You wanted to know something?  How can I help you?
string 33
What are these Talismans of which I hear?
string 34
I would like to know about Sir Cabirus.
string 35
Canst tell me more of the groups in the Abyss?
string 36
'Tis very kind of thee to take time to help me, your majesty.
string 37
Oh, mention it not!  It is so seldom that I get a chance to speak to a really intelligent person!
 I mean, our allies the Lizardmen are nice enough, but the poor fellows can't speak a word of the common tongue. They understand it well enough, but the poor things don't have the mouth to speak it.  And their language is so difficult! I know "Sseth" and "'click" mean "yes" and "no," but I don't know which is which!\m
string 38
Then there are the Knights of the Crux Ansata -- they can talk well enough, but all they ever say is how many Trolls they've killed.  Frightful bore, even if it does help keep the pest population down -- both kinds of pests, Knights AND Trolls, you know.
string 39
It must be a trial, even for one as noble as yourself.
string 40
What of these Talismans?
string 41
I would like to know about Sir Cabirus.
string 42
Are there other groups here in the Abyss?
string 43
Oh, indeed it is!  Sometimes I wonder how I even manage.  It wasn't always like this, you know.
 When Sir Cabirus was alive, things were ever so much better.  He had all of us working together so well.  A born leader was that man.
 When he founded this colony you could have made a wager anywhere in Britannia that it wouldn't work, but he made it so.
 I still think one of those bastard Grays must have done him in. There were certain items, too...\m
string 44
Well, I suppose it will do no harm to tell thee.  Sir Cabirus collected eight great Talismans, each embodying a certain Virtue -- he was a great one for Virtue, was our Cabirus -- and it was well known that he intended them to come to the leaders of the various groups here in the Abyss.  Well, WE never saw them.  If they still exist, they must be lost.
 But I must be boring thee.
string 45
Well, actually, yes.
string 46
No, not at all.
string 47
I could listen forever, your Majesty, but I've taken enough of thy time.
string 48
Well, bless you, you're such a charming conversationalist.  Please do visit again.
string 49
Well!  I never!
string 50
Well thou hast now!
string 51
I beg thy pardon, but I must go now.
string 52
Oh, thou'rt just saying that.  I'm sure there's much more for thee to do than listen me me natter on.
 And if you should happen to meet "King" Ketchaval or "Queen" Retichall of the Gray Goblins, be a dear and stick a knife in them, would you?
string 53
Farewell, your Majesty.
string 54
Goodbye, milord.

string 25
That is plain!  Art thou willing to sacrifice thy life to join our Order?
string 26
Yes, I am.
string 27
No!
string 28
Wait!  I can explain!
string 29
And dost thou submit to our Justice?
string 30
Indeed, I do.
string 31
No, I do not.
string 32
Perhaps we should discuss this.
string 33
Very well.  Thou hast earned death by coming here, and thou shalt have thy reward.  Here is a cup, which bears within it a venom both swift and deadly.  Take it and drink it.
string 34
Very well.
string 35
And if I refuse?
string 36
Then thou art no candidate worthy of our Order! Leave here, and return when thou art.
string 37
Ah, good Sir Cabirus!  Many of our Order seek his Talismans, for they are said to confer Virtue both in the seeking and the finding.  I cannot, however, share our knowledge about these things with one who is not an initiate of our Order.
string 38
May I join thy Order?
string 39
Very well.  I understand.  Good day to thee.
string 40
You take the cup.  Within it is a is a clear, odorless liquid.  You raise it to your lips and . . .  
string 41
Fling it to the floor.
string 42
Drink it in a draught.

string 47
The taste of it is like pure water.  You wait for several moments, and nothing happens.  Then a voice cries out in mourning and a funeral dirge plays. 
string 48
@SS1 who drank from the cup is now dead.  In @SS2 place stands @GS8, Esquire of the Order of the Crux Ansata.  Tell me, wert thou afraid?
string 49
Yes.
string 50
No.
string 51
Good!  To know fear is the first step to knowing Valor.  Thou art now a Squire of this Order.\m
string 52
Thy quest is to find the writ of Lorne, a document written by one of the the first Knights who settled this order in the Abyss.
  The document was written during the early years of the Colony, and it contains much knowledge of that time.  However, it is now gone, though many suspect it is in the troll homeland.
 Seek it, and when thou returns here with it, a knight of our order thou wilt become.
string 53
I thank thee.  May I prove worthy of the honor.  Fare thee well.
string 54
I thank thee.  Canst thou tell me aught of Cabirus' Talismans?  They are also my quest.
string 55
Brother
string 56
Sister
string 57
Precious little.  They numbered eight, and Cabirus did intend them to go each to one of the Leaders of the eight groups who settled the Abyss.  Alas, he perished, and all eight were lost.
 'Tis said they were a Book, bottle of Wine, a Shield, a Sword, a Taper, a Standard, a Cup, and a Ring.  Each was imbued with the potent power of a single Virtue, and 'tis said they confer Virtue both in the seeking and the finding.\m
string 58
Of the Standard thou dost know, since thou hast earned it by defeating Rodrick, the Chaos Knight.  The Taper was stolen, unfortunately. Thou seest how the virtues have suffered since the death of Cabirus.
string 59
I know only of the Taper and the Standard.  The Taper of Sacrifice was stolen from us only recently, and we know not its current whereabouts. As for the Standard of Honor, it is said that it is awaiting one who would perform a sufficiently honorable deed.
string 60
Farewell, Brother, and thanks!
string 61
Goodbye.
string 62
That is good.  To learn is to better oneself.  How may we advance thy knowledge?
string 63
Tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus.
string 64
What knowest thou of the Trolls?
string 65
Tell me of thy order.
string 66
The Trolls?  They are our ancient foes.  We are fortunate in that many of them are honorable, in their own way.  Some are not, of course.  Feral Trolls, we call them. Beware of these.  All are deadly foes, but at least the civilized ones fight honorably.
string 67
Thank thee for the advice.
string 68
Thy standards appeal to me.  How may I join thy Order?
string 69
Greeting, Squire @GS8!  How didst thou fare in thy quest?
string 70
I have succeeded!  Here is the writ.
string 71
I have not yet completed my quest.
string 72
Sir
string 73
Lady
string 74
Hail, @SS1 @GS8!  How fares thy quest?
string 75
I have succeeded!  Here is the plate.
string 76
I have not yet completed my quest.
string 77
Sir
string 78
Lady
string 79
Now thou art @SS1 @GS8, Knight of the Order of the Crux Ansata. Take thou this helm of plate, worthy of a Knight.  Would that we had a horse to give thee as well, for 'tis proper for a Knight.
string 80
Here, I'll just put it on the floor for thee.
string 81
Are there any more lost artifacts in need of retrieval?
string 82
How else may I serve the Order?
string 83
Thou hast done well; thy quest is accomplished.  Well done!\m
string 84
No, I am afraid that is not the writ.
string 85
Perhaps this is it.
string 86
I will return when I have found it.
string 87
Good luck in thy continuing quest.
string 88
There shall be no discussion.  Thou mayst go or stay, and accept the consequences of thy decision.
string 89
I shall stay.
string 90
Very well.
string 91
I shall be going.
string 92
Return when thou art truly ready to become an initiate of our order.
string 93
Thy quest is accomplished. Well done!
 All things that belong to the order now belong  to thee.  I have opened the door to the armory, and thou mayst go there and take items as thou dost need them to accomplish  the quests and goals thou dost set for thyself.
string 94
Now what wouldst thou have of me?
string 95
I thank thee. Now I must be going.
string 96
That is not it. Try again.
string 97
All that I can tell thee I have told.  Seek the virtues on thy own through what is left of our once noble colony.  Good luck and honor on thy quests.
string 98
Thou hast killed the bastard knight who held the north of our home to be his.  I thank thee for bringing honor back to our order and clearing the villain from our homes.
 The action thou hast taken has proven that thou art most worthy.  To reward thee for thy deeds, I offer thee the Standard of Honor, one of the Talismans fashioned by Cabirus.
string 99
My thanks.  I am honored indeed to bear it.
string 100
No thank you.  I would not know what to do with it.
string 101
Hast thou reconsidered my offer?
string 102
Yes, I desire the standard of honor.
string 103
No thank thee, I must be going.
string 104
No, but I would like to speak with thee.
string 105
I shall speak with thee, but I strongly urge thee to take this standard.
string 106
Dorna turns and rummages through a large iron case, returning soon with a golden standard which he holds before you.
string 107
Here it is.  Bear it with honor and remember those who bore it before thee.  Honor their memory with thy deeds, for the deeds  thou hast already done honor thee in our memory.
string 108
Here, I'll just put it on the floor for you.
string 109
I thank thee, and shall take thy words to heart.
string 110
If thou dost ever desire it, return to me and ask for it.
string 111
I shall, and soon.
string 112
Both it and I shall be waiting.
string 113
Thou shalt wait a long time afore I return, I believe.
string 114
We shall see.
string 115
The order once owned a golden plate.  Years ago it was stolen by a thief who I will not even describe, for he is not worth the time it would take.  He fled into the maze and was not seen again.
 Since then, it was rumored to have been found several times.  The last rumor placed it at the grave of Sir Ingvar.  Find it and thou wilt rise even further as a Knight.
string 116
I thank thee.  Until we meet again...
string 117
Another quest!  Is there no end?
string 118
Thou hast seen the truth of it!  The quest for enlightenment is never-ending. Yet, if thou dost persist in this small quest, thou mayst find rewards to help thee  on the greater quest.
string 119
Very well.  Until we meet again...
string 120
I am sorry to hear it.  Hast spoken to all in this area?  Surely someone can help thee?
string 121
If I must...  Farewell.
string 122
I'll try.  Until we meet again...
string 123
Thou art one of us now.  Thou art always welcome here.
string 124
I thank thee and am glad to hear that.
string 125
Wouldst thou please reopen the armory?
string 126
Surely.  I'll have it done right away.
string 127
What canst thou tell me of Sir Cabirus' Talismans?
string 128
Well I am glad thou desirest my company.  However, I am a very busy man, and I don't have time now to talk.  Many of the knights of the order are willing to reminisce and talk.  Thou shouldst seek them out.
string 129
Thank thee, and farewell.
string 130
Canst thou just tell me a bit of the nature of thy order?
string 131
Our goal is that of the Avatar - to advance in our knowledge of virtue, in order to better ourselves.  When a quest presents itself that will further our understanding of virtue, we undertake it gladly.  Perhaps our quests also make Britannia a better place.\m
string 132
Unfortunately, Rodrick, one of our order, recently abandoned his principles and took up residence in the banquet hall to the north, calling himself the "Chaos Knight" and terrorizing the inhabitants of that area.  We sent one of our knights, Biden, to defeat him, but he has not returned.  I fear the worst.
string 133
Thank thee, and farewell.
string 134
May I join thy order?
string 135
Perhaps I could defeat him.
string 136
That would be most honorable of thee, if thou didst truly defeat him and restore peace to our settlement.  But I must warn thee that he is an opponent as dishonorable as he is dangerous, and he would not likely spare thy life were he to outfight thee.
string 137
I will take care with him, then.
string 138
May I join thy order?
string 139
Thank thee for thy advice, and farewell.

Hail to thee, bold traveller.  I am Morlock.

Excuse me, I must be going.

What canst thou tell me of thy people?

I have something for thee.

I am in search of adventure.
string 6
Well, I can tell thee that one of my comrades, the mage Bronus, has need of thy services.  Deliver to me an object of his,  and thou shalt be rewarded.
string 7
In fact, I have already acquired that object from him.
string 8
Perhaps I shall run across him.
string 9
I have no interest in running errands.
string 10
Ah!  Well, I believe that my fellow mage Bronus has something for me.  If thou wouldst deliver it to me, perhaps I can help thee further.

Ah!  Thou hast brought my book!  Excellent!
string 16
Thou sayest thou hast something for me?
string 17
Yes, here it is.
string 18
No, thou dost misunderstand.
string 19
None of this is mine.  Dost thou really have an item of mine?
string 20
Yes, here it is.
string 21
No, I'm afraid not.
string 22
Perhaps the errand was too difficult for thee.  But no matter.
string 23
Well, if thou dost acquire that object, please do not delay in bringing it to me.
string 24
Thou art @GS8, art thou not?
string 25
Aye, that is my name.
string 26
Nay.  I have not heard of this @GS8.
string 27
Thou knowest I am.
string 28
Ah!  Why didst thou not say so?
string 29
I was simply going to reward thee for bringing me my book, but now I hear that thou hast met and slain the fearsome Fire Hydra. That eight-headed monster has long menaced our peaceable folk.  Well done!  Thou hast earned an even greater reward!

Assuredly.  I was wondering from whom I might get my reward.

I beg thy pardon.  I slew no such beast.

string 43
Well, if I should meet @GS8, I shall greet @SS1 for thee.  Goodbye.
string 44
Ah, I had thought as much.  Thou didst fit the description.
string 45
Thy reward shall be a powerful book.  Thou shalt find it in a room behind a secret door in the Library.
string 46
Thank thee.  I shall be on my way to collect my reward.
string 47
Hmm.  Well, excuse me, I must be going.
string 48
Thy honesty is commendable, and thy reward shall be the Book of Honesty.  As Honesty and Truth are beyond Time, thou shalt find it by the key behind the hourglass.
string 49
Well, I thank thee.  I shall be off to retrieve it now.
string 50
What can thou tell me of this Book?
string 51
The book was one of Sir Cabirus' Talismans.  'Twas written by Ravenhurst of Moonglow, who collected great works of honesty and essays upon Truth.  It hath great power, both intrinsically and for the wisdom contained therein.
string 52
Well, I thank thee.  I shall be off to retrieve it now.
string 53
Thank thee.
string 54
Hello again.  Hast thou an object for me?
string 55
Yes, here it is.
string 56
No, I do not.
string 57
Of what object dost thou speak?
string 58
My fellow mage Bronus wishes to deliver something to me.  Seek him out. If thou bringst the object to me, I may reward thee.
string 59
Ah, it is @GS8 again.
string 60
Greetings once more.  Hast thou found @GS8 yet?
string 61
Actually, I am @GS8.
string 62
No, I have not.
string 63
Well, if thou findest @GS8, please let me know.  I am looking for him.
string 64
Hello again.  What dost thou want from me now?
string 65
I merely wanted to thank thee again.
string 66
I was just stopping by to say hello.
string 67
I must admit that I slew no Fire Hydra.
string 68
Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found thy reward?
string 69
Yes, and I thank thee.
string 70
No, not yet.
string 71
I must admit that I do not deserve this reward.  I slew no Fire Hydra.
string 72
How kind of thee.  I wish thee continued luck with thy quests.
string 73
I hope thou useth it well, for thou richly deserveth it.
string 74
It should not be hard to find.
string 75
Remember, it lies with the key behind the hourglass.
string 76
Remember, it is behind a secret door in the Library.
string 77
Ah!  The truth is out!  Well, at least thou wert honest eventually.  I am not sure whether thou really deservest the Book of Honesty, but perhaps thou hast learned from thy mistakes.  As Honesty and Truth are beyond Time, thou shalt find it by the key behind the hourglass.
string 78
Thank thee, and farewell.
string 79
Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found thy reward?
string 80
Yes, and I thank thee kindly.
string 81
No, not yet.

Thy directions were quite confusing.
string 83
Congratulations!  I hope that it will prove useful to thee.
string 84
Congratulations again on thy discovery.  I wish thee luck in thy continuing quest.
string 85
I make thee this offer.
string 86
I demand thou givest me these items.
string 87
Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
string 88
I do not wish to barter any further.
string 89
Farewell.

I accept thy offer.
string 91
No, I do not like this deal.

Dost thou take me for a fool?

I am weary of this haggling.
string 94
Surely thou art joking.
string 95
Dost thou intend to rob me?

Yes, I must.

If thou dost insist, thou canst have them.

Nothing in particular.  I merely came to enjoy thy company.

I came here to learn courtesy from a master.

Ah!  Sarcasm!  Very well, thou hast made thy point!  Now, quickly, what dost thou need?
string 7
Canst tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
string 8
I seek some missing runestones.
string 9
I have no more runestones for thee!  Perhaps thou shouldst learn to use the ones thou hast.
string 10
Perhaps I can help thee after all, but first I will need to see thy runebag.
string 11
Certainly.  Here it is.
string 12
No, I am sorry.  I dare not let this out of my hands.

Ah, yes.  A budding mage indeed.  I suppose thou wouldst like to have a Flam runestone?

Surely.

Thank thee, but no.

Yes, here is my runebag.

No, I dare not part with it.

No, but thank thee.

Yes.  Canst thou tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?

What work art thou doing?

Where is that accursed stone?  I must have lost it.

I thank thee kindly, Dr. Owl.

Very well, very well.  Now get on with thee!

I am divining.  I seek my mute servant, Murgo, who is missing.

Perhaps I might find him for thee.
string 30
I am sorry to hear it.

Bah!  What is it THIS time?
string 32
Canst thou tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
string 33
I seek some missing runestones.
string 34
I beg thy pardon, I thought thou wert another.
string 35
I know where there is a bottle of the so-called Wine of Compassion!  Bah!  Such foolishness.  Only babes and fools believe in such fairy-stories.
string 36
Wilt thou tell me where to find it?
string 37
Thou'rt probably right.  Sorry to have bothered thee.
string 38
If thou canst locate and return my missing servant Murgo, I shall tell thee where to find the Wine of Compassion.
string 39
Then I shall find him and return him.
string 40
Never mind.  Thou art too much trouble.
string 41
If I see him I shall let thee know.
string 42
Very well, have it thy way!  Was there anything else, or may I return to my work in peace?
string 43
No, but thank thee.
string 44
Yes.  Canst thou tell me of the talismans of Sir Cabirus?
string 45
What work art thou doing?
string 46
I have no time for idle chit-chat!  Be off with thee!
string 47
Bah!  Nonsense!  Get thyself gone from here, or I shall make thee wish thou had!
string 48
Very well, then.  Goodbye!
string 49
No!  Wait!  My need is great.
string 50
A pity, then, that thou art not more civil to thy betters.  What will it take to get thee to leave me in peace?
string 51
Canst tell me of the Talismans of Sir Cabirus?
string 52
I seek some missing runestones.
string 53
Nothing.  I'll not bother thee again.
string 54
Well?  Hast thou news of my servant?
string 55
Yes.  Murgo lies above in the dungeons of the Lizardmen.
string 56
Nay.  I have seen him not.
string 57
Thou canst find the Wine of Compassion in the checkerboard room to the east of the meeting hall of the Academy.  Lift the southeastern floor tile and the Wine shall be revealed.
string 58
Thank thee, and farewell.
string 59
While I am here, dost thou know of any runestones I can find?
string 60
'Tis thee again.  I note that Murgo has not been returned to me.  Wert thou not going to find him in return for directions to the Wine of Compassion?
string 61
Yes, I am still looking.
string 62
I shall endeavor to bring him back promptly.
string 63
Perhaps later.
string 64
Obviously thou'rt not a great adventurer. A great adventurer would surely have succeeded in thy quest by now!
string 65
'Tis thee again.  What dost thou want?
string 66
Nothing, I was just leaving.
string 67
What art thou so busy with?
string 68
I seek new runestones.
string 69
Ah, it is the one who hast freed my servant Murgo!  Thou'rt more compassionate towards thy fellows than I might expect.  Thy reward shall be fitting.
string 70
Greetings, @GS11.  What dost thou want?  I warn thee, I am quite busy.
string 71
I cannot seem to find the Wine of Compassion.
string 72
It's quite simple.
string 73
Canst thou direct me to more runestones?
string 74
I'm sorry, I did not mean to bother thee.

A greeting to you I give.  Ishtass I am known as.  What thing you are wanting?
string 2
Amazing.  You speak my language!
string 3
Nothing, but I thank thee.  Excuse me.

Though by other Thepa the Quiet Ones my people are called, this an irony is. We alone of the Thepa your language can speak.

string 13
Ah.  Can you perhaps translate their speech for me?
string 14
Interesting.  Canst tell me any history?
string 15
Nay, against our oaths it goes.  We a humble order are, sworn secrets to keep.  Perhaps one among your people the True Speech knows.
string 16
Perhaps.  Thanks anyway.
string 17
Thanks for nothing!
string 18

After Sir Cabirus death, mumbling wizard began upriver working.  He talked with me after, as your strange tongue we know.  Spoke he, who nameless remains, of a Great Sword, apart he broke.
string 27
Tell me more!

Please talk no more.  I must go.

Ossikka, leader of ours, upstream travelled, a great many-armed water beast known to Thepa as kri'kla to kill.  He returned never.  Would you him find?
string 34
I cannot at this time.  Perhaps later.
string 35
I will search for your leader!
string 36
Upstream Ossikka travelled, returning never.  Book of mad wizard had he, perhaps telling more.  Return with news and the Quiet One will reward handsomely you.
string 37
I shall search for Ossikka.
string 38
Not welcome here thou art!
string 39

Again, a greeting to you I give.

string 44
Dost have any news of the world?
string 45
I have more questions about the sword.
string 46
Of you I worry.  Perhaps I should not help.
string 47
Fine.  I bid thee goodbye.
string 48
Oh, please, kind Ishtass.  Can you not help me?
string 49
Is good thing Ishtass nice.  Many civilized groups are still found in the Abyss and must be treated with much kindness.  Important it is to know this.
string 50
Please, adventurer, what Ossikka news have you?
string 51
I have found this.
string 52
No news yet.  Sorry.
string 53
This nothing me tells.  Please something of Ossikka find?
string 54
I will continue my search.
string 55
Oh.  How about this?
string 56
Why yes, of this Ossikka did have.  Oh, what means this?
string 57
I found his bones in a room upstream.
string 58
Sorry day, indeed.  Still, thank you.  Here, a gift for you is.
string 59
On floor, I leave it for you.
string 60
Thank you very much.
string 61
Canst thou now tell me of the sword?
string 62
What you to know want?
string 63
You have told me enough.  Thank you.
string 64
Where can I find the Sword?
string 65
Sword in two pieces broken is.  Wizard took haft below.  Ossikka clue to blade found, he said.  Blade somewhere in our domain is, I think.  More than that I do not know.
string 66
Thank you for your help.
string 67
I will continue my search.

Yes, here is some.

No, but I will look for some.

No.  How is it made?

Hmm... I no remember.  I know you use dead rotworm.  My mother knew, but she dead.  Maybe someone else.  Oh, that stew delicious!
string 15
I will try to make some.
string 16
I will seek out someone who knows the recipe.
string 17
Hmm, let me see... Aha!  I still have dragon scales.  I kill nasty dragon when I was a young troll.  Big and breathed fire.  It could sit on lava forever without burning up.  I kill it and save its scales.  Never use them though.  Now I old troll, I like simple pleasures, I no need them. Maybe if you give me something, I trade for scales.
string 18
What wouldst thou like?
string 19
Maybe I can trade thee some gold.

No, I no need treasure any more.  Just simple nice things like wormy stew.

Speaking of innocence, hast seen a maiden in distress?

Begone, liar!  Thou art a charlatan and worse!

A young girl was this?  Beauteous, but innocent?
string 14
Aye, that was she.
string 15
I never saw her.  I am innocent of the charge.
string 16
I would assume so.
string 17
We did see her but hours agone, carried by a troll and pursued by a pack of fools!  They fell afoul of the Gobs, to be sure.
string 18
Ah, she is long gone by now.  A troll carried her below. Almric's men were in pursuit, but they proved no match for the Gobs.

I thank thee.  I must seek them to prove my innocence!
string 21
Where be she now?

Still, I must recover her to clear my name.  Goodbye.
string 23
Aye, the Goblins.  There be the Greens and the Grays, and they are deadly foes.  They make our lives more difficult still with their vendettas.
string 24
What is the nature of their feud?
string 25
Which cause is just?
string 26
And are they the only inhabitants aside from thee?
string 27
None can say.  Their conflict seems to have begun at the time of the Great Collapse, when the civilization of the under-earth fell.  We know only that their leaders have sworn never to agree on anything.

I thank thee.  Thou hast helped me greatly.

Good day to thee again, if day it is outside!
string 36
Hast thou news of the girl I seek?
string 37
And a good day to thee.  I must journey onward in my search.
string 38
Since thou art so kind, I shall take thee up on thy generous offer of absence.  Goodbye!
string 39
No, she's long gone.  Thou shouldst hurry if thou dost wish to catch her.
string 40
Surely thou art one among us who was condemned by that pious oaf Baron Almric.  We of the Outcasts are the survivors of his intemperate justice, fugitives from the predations of the Gobs.
string 41
Ah, perhaps then thou canst tell me of his daughter.
string 42
What are these Gobs of whom thou doth speak?

I shall be on my way.

Ah... None who have ventured past the realm of the Gobs have returned.  But rumor hath it there are worse perils below.

Well, I thank thee anyway.  Farewell.

Perhaps I can solve the mystery for thee.
string 47
You cowards!  Have none of you the courage to venture down yourselves?
string 48
Some goblins no longer abide the commands of their leaders, but wander the corridors in search of prey.  They take from our supplies of food and are a danger as well.  Would that we were rid of them.

string 25
How didst thou come to be here?
string 26
Have none ever escaped?
string 27
Greetings, @GS8!  Hast thou spoken with Hagbard?
string 28
Hello again, stranger.  Hast spoken to our leader?
string 29
Who is he again?
string 30
Yes.
string 31
No.
string 32
Do so!
string 33
I have been called 'the Blessed' since my prison days, when I was considered lucky because I have a taste for cockroaches.  I never went hungry, thou seest.
string 34
How very nice for thee... I must be going.
string 35
And is this place better than a prison?
string 36
That's repulsive!
string 37
Then thou shouldst speak with Hagbard.  He is our leader.
string 38
Perhaps I will.
string 39
I will seek him out.
string 40
I have better things to do with my time.
string 41
Greetings!  What may I do for thee?
string 42
I thank thee, but I must be going.
string 43
What didst thou say thy name was?
string 44
Know ye anything of what lies below?
string 45
How can one find useful items?
string 46
Ah, I remember.  He was talking to thee earlier!  Well, may I help thee?
string 47
I thank thee, but I must be going.
string 48
What didst thou say thy name was?
string 49
Know ye anything of what lies below?
string 50
How can one find useful items?
string 51
Thou needs must speak with Hagbard.  He alone, of all of us, retains his sanity amidst the madness of this place.
string 52
Very well.  I shall seek him out.
string 53
Before I do, what IS this place?
string 54
It was not always such.  Once, a leader name Sir Cabirus (curst be his name!) had the foolish notion that this place could be colonized.
 When his folly caught up with him, the "civilization" of the under-earth fell, and we now scrabble to survive in its ruins. 
 He died, and so escaped the punishment for his crime.  Dreamers!  They will be the death of us all!
string 55
And thyself? How camest thou here?
string 56
Perhaps he was merely an idealist.
string 57
I killed a man who needed killing.  My crime was being caught.
string 58
Perhaps thou wouldst find peace if thou didst repent.
string 59
Well, I must be going.  Fare thee well.
string 60
Escape!  Ha!  There be no escape from this place, barring the Final Escape of death. When the colony fell, a mighty spell was laid on the Great Gate.  Now it cannot be opened save from the outside.
string 61
Perhaps I know a way.
string 62
'Tis a great misfortune, surely.  I sympathize with thee.
string 63
And perhaps thou art a fool!  Good day to thee!
string 64
Good day.
string 65
We shall see.
string 66
Below us now?  Why, the flaming heart of the volcano, I would surmise.  And below that lie the bowels of Britannia.  Think, friend, someday thou wilt be part of that, and not another  body thrashing about in these caverns we call home.
string 67
I see.  Goodbye!
string 68
Ah, thou shouldst know that it is often easier to find useful items by bartering than simply by scavenging.  Find thyself someone who is willing to trade, and give him the items thou dost not need in exchange for more useful ones.\m
string 69
Keep in mind whom thou art dealing with.  I hear that the Mountainfolk are fond of gold, for example, while Goblins may not be as attached to it.
string 70

 An' then one o' them headless creatures came runnin' in, and brave Tom WOULD fight wi' it.  The both of them went into the lava! Ah, me Tom!  And I have sat here these long years.  Some o' the folk nearby take pity on me, bring me things to eat.  But nary one will stay and watch wi' me for my Tom.
string 33
Isn't it unlikely that he will return from the lava?
string 34
I will sit with thee.
string 35
Ah, that's me Tom.  Always worrying me.  Ah, Tom, come up, thou'rt worrying thy Judy!  Ah, me, I canna e'en recall his face, he's so long lost t' me!
string 36
Hast thou naught else to remember him by?
string 37
I'm sorry to hear of it.  Goodbye, now.

I had me a picture once, but 'tis lost now.  Ah, me Tom! Such a bonny lad I never knew.

Well, if I should find it, I shall return it thee.

Didst thou?  I found a picture.  Perhaps it is yours.
string 41
Ah, well, I must be away.
string 42
Ah, dost bring word o' my Tom?

I have found a picture.
string 44
Tom is dead, thou old fool!
string 45
Nay, I am sorry.

Wouldst thou?  Ah, thou art very kind.  Bless thee.
string 47
Blessings upon thee also, old mother.
string 48
Goodbye.
string 49
Nay!  He but hides from me.  'Tis a game he plays.  Tom!  Tom, come up now, me lad, thou'rt bringing me a fright!
string 50
Excuse me, I must be going. 
string 51
Good luck with thy vigil, and farewell.
string 52
Ah, nay, thou'rt very kind, but I'm sure an important person such as yerself has better to do with thy time.  If it's helping me thou wouldst like, bring me word of me bonny Tom.
string 53
Very well.   Good day to thee.

She begins weeping profusely, and a tear falls into the lava.  After it strikes the surface, a gold key appears in its place.

He nods sadly, then performs a complicated series of charades that seem to indicate that he is innocent.
 He mimes vicious Lizardmen grabbing a wide-eyed victim and laughing heartily as they fling him in this cell.
 He implores you, by gestures, to speak to the Lizardmen and get him released.

I'm sorry, but I don't understand their language.

No, I'd rather not get involved.

He gestures at himself indicating that HE understands the tongue of the Lizardmen.  Further, he makes signs that seem to say the Lizardmen understand YOUR speech, but cannot pronounce human talk themselves.

So!  Another young fool opens a door thoughtlessly.  Open, close, open, close, that's all that anyone ever has the time for.  Things were not like this when I was thy age, I can assure thee of that!  Well?  Hast thou anything to say for thyself?
string 2
I'm sorry to disturb thee.  I'll leave now.
string 3
Excuse me... art thou really a door?
string 4
I mean to open thee, not to talk with thee!
string 5
Perhaps if thou wert more civil, thou couldst open more doors!
string 6
Thou again!  What dost thou want this time!
string 7
Hmmph!  Perhaps the next time thou wilt show greater civilty to thy elders!
string 8
Bah!  Such disrepect!  I will open when I wish to open!
string 9
What do I look like, a drawbridge?
string 10
In fact, thou bearest a remarkable resemblance to one.
string 11
Thy point is made.  How didst thou come to be a door?
string 12
I once was a young human like thyself.  But I grew weary of the regular folk and their immense stupidity.  I was a brilliant mage, and was constantly pestered with silly questions, such as "How does one cast Sheet Lightning?"
 Tiring of being hounded thus, I turned myself into a door in order to finally enjoy some peace and quiet.  Obviously, it didn't work.
string 13
Now that thou dost mention it, how does one cast Sheet Lightning?
string 14
Canst thou not turn thyself back into a human?
string 15
Gaaah!  I cannot believe thou wouldst ask that, of all questions!  I should have known better than to mention that accursed spell.
 If thou must know, it is cast by using the Vas, Ort and Grav runestones.  There.  I hope that thou blowest thyself up with it.
string 16
Thank thee kindly, wise door.
string 17
At last!  Now my power is increased even more!
string 18
Art thou implying that my power is not great enough to turn myself into whatever I want?  If I wanted to, I could turn myself into a nutcracker and thee into a walnut!  Wouldst thou like that?
string 19
Surely not.
string 20
I'd like to see thee try!
string 21
Well then, didst thou attempt to open me for a reason, or simply because my doorknob was a bright shiny object?
string 22
Thou didst mention a Sheet Lightning spell..
string 23
I wish to pass through to thy other side.
string 24
No, I'm sorry to have disturbed thee.
string 25
Very well, if it means that thou wilt not bother me again.
string 26
Unfortunately, my hinges seem to be somewhat rusty.
string 27
Couldst thou please open for me?
string 28
I forget how to cast Sheet Lightning.
string 29
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother thee.
string 30
Canst thou tell me of thy history?
string 31
Couldst thou please open for me?
string 32
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother thee.
string 33
Canst thou teach me the Sheet Lightning spell of which thou spoke?
string 34
Couldst thou please open for me?
string 35
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bother thee.
string 36
I refuse to help thee with that any more!
string 37
Again!?  For the last time, the spell is cast by using the Vas, Ort, and Grav runestones.  I don't know why I'm bothering to tell thee. Thou obviously hast not the intelligence necessary to cast it.
string 38
I make thee this offer.
string 39
I demand thou givest me these items.
string 40
Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
string 41
I do not wish to barter any further.

Good day to thee, my young @SS1.  I am Celaven, and I seek a certain wand.  Hast thou seen it?
string 4
What sort of wand was this?
string 5
Yes, I believe I have it here.
string 6
I have seen no wands.
string 7
It had the property of casting fireballs.  One of my better works, actually.  I particularly like the way the fireballs look.  Not enough mages take pride in the little details like that.  Then I loaned it to a friend of
 mine, and I think she must have blown herself up with it.  A pity, thou knowst, but there thou art.  Perhaps I should have made sure she knew which end to hold.  At any rate, it has been missing since.  Hast thou seen it?
string 8
Yes, I believe this is it.
string 9
I have seen no such wand.
string 10
A pity.  I felt sure an explorer such as thyself might have run across it. It could be dangerous in the wrong hands, thou knowest.  Art certain thou hast seen it not?

Well, come to think of it, I do have a wand here.  Could this be thine?

Absolutely.  I would remember such an item.

We shall see.
string 18
Ah, at last!  May I examine it please?
string 19
Certainly, here you are.
string 20
Is it yours, or isn't it?
string 21
Ah.  Now this IS nice.  Very nice indeed.  'Tis not my mine, though.  Unless I'm mistaken, this is the work of Corey Confundo, a most excellent mage indeed.  Thou shouldst consider thyself lucky to have such a tool.  May it serve thee well.
string 22
Will thou not accept it in place of the one thou lost?
string 23
Thank thee kindly. I hope thou findest thy wand.
string 24
Goodbye.
string 25
Ah, we meet again.  Hast news of my wand?
string 26
What sort of wand was this again?
string 27
Is this it?
string 28
I have seen it not.
string 29
Well, thou need not be so snappy!  Just hold it up there, that's it.  No, I'm afraid mine is much nicer than that.  Should expect that one might blow off thine hand.  Well, if thou wilt excuse me, I must be going.
string 30
Fare thee well. I hope thou findest thy wand.
string 31
Goodbye.
string 32
Nay, thou art too generous.  My interest is not in any wand, but the one I myself created.  Still, such generosity must be rewarded.  Thou might not know it, but the wand thou hast posseses another setting. . . There.  I think thou shalt find it all the better now.  Good day to thee.

Thank thee kindly. I hope thou findest thy wand.

string 1
Thou hast done well.  And now that my bones are at last at rest I can speak freely to thee.  But my spirit cannot rest while yet this peril remains.
 We must open a gate, near where the foul creature my brother summoned lies bound. We must return it to the plane from whence it came.
string 2
Is there no other way?
string 3
How can we open such a gate?
string 4
No other power can defeat it.  Even banishing it to another place will do it no harm -- may in fact restore to it its full power, if that place be like to its own -- but it will at least remove the threat to Britannia!
string 5
How can this be done?
string 6
For this I will need a great deal of magical energy. This will be no gentle luring such as brought thee here, but an unimaginable vortex of interplanar energy.
string 7
Might Tyball's Orb have sufficed, had it not been destroyed?
string 8
Where can we find such powerful magic?
string 9
Tyball's Orb would be perilous to use, even if it were intact.  The power we tap must be carefully chosen...  As thou may have guessed, I am a little out of touch with thy world.  I had hoped thou might provide an answer.
string 10
I'm afraid I have no idea.
string 11
What be the qualifications for what thou needest?
string 12
It would be best if the source were absolutely pure -- my brother found the danger in tapping powers whose source thou knowest not -- and 'twould be best if Britannia herself were somehow involved.
string 13
How dost thou mean, "Britannia involved?"
string 14
The source must be pure?
string 15
'Twould help to invoke one of the Elements.  We work for Britannia's succor, and we must hope she would lend what aid she could.
string 16
The Elements?
string 17
Thou speakest as though Britannia is alive.
string 18
But the source of the magic must be pure?
string 19
The classical four: earth, air, fire, and water.
string 20
Indeed she is, a green and living entity.  Not conscious as we know it, but perhaps aware that we work to her ends.
string 21
Yes, the source, which, if we are fortunate, may even wake Britannia to our aid, should be as pure as possible.  Else we risk ending like my brother.
string 22
My mind is a blank.
string 23
Other...
string 24
Talismans
string 25
Talisman
string 26
No, that will not do.  Perhaps something else...
string 27
Perhaps thou shouldst ponder the problem for a bit longer.  But think carefully and quickly, for the fate of Britannia is at stake!
string 28
Perhaps some item or items imbued with Virtue might be of use, if any exist.  Dost thou know of any such items?
string 29
Yes, of course!  Those would do admirably.  Now, we must find a means to unleash their stored Virtue.  We must find some latent source of power that can be released by applying the energy of the Talismans.
string 30
I cannot think of anything appropriate.
string 31
Other...
string 32
volcano
string 33
lava
string 34
No, we need a great source of power that might easily be released.
string 35
Well, I hope that thou art able to solve the problem quickly, for the fate of Britannia itself hangs in the balance!
string 36
Perhaps some natural landmark that contains the ability to release great power will do the trick.
string 37
Yes, of course!  If all eight Talismans be thrust into the volcano's maw, one at a time, I could ride the wave of such power to open the vortex. Ah, thou art wise as well as valorous!  Wilt thou make such a sacrifice?
string 38
Think again, ghost.  Thou knowest not the troubles I went through to obtain those!
string 39
Aye, though it pains me sorely to lose such tools as these.
string 40
But thou must!  Thy sacrifice shall save all of this world!  Surely thou cannot place thine own travails and successes against such a stake as that!
string 41
Very well, thou art correct.  I shall do it!
string 42
I shall think on it.
string 43
Excellent!  Make haste to the lowest place, where thou must cast all eight into the Abyss -- hold back not one, upon thy peril!  When they are consumed by earth's own fire, I shall leash the torrent to gape wide my gate.  With Fortune's smile, we shall send our foe screeching back to its Hell!
string 44
Where can I find a way into the volcano?
string 45
Very well!  Look for me there!
string 46
The Chamber of Virtue is located on the lowest level of the Abyss.  It lies at the very center of the volcano, where the energy fields of the Stygian are their strongest.  'Tis said that a special three-part key is needed to enter, but I know not the veracity of this legend.
string 47
I will make my way there.
string 48
Hurry!  There is little time to lose!
string 49
Hurry, @GS8, there is no time to lose!  Thou must cast all eight of Cabirus' Talismans into the volcano on the lowest level of the Abyss.  Do not fail in thy quest!
string 50
Yes?  Hast thou discovered a source of energy with which the power of Cabirus' Talismans can be released?
string 51
Yes?  Hast thou thought of a pure source of power and virtue which may provide me with the requisite amount of magical energy?

Thank you, I will be.

Hail, stranger!  What be thy business?  I have not seen thee in this place before.
string 4
I am merely exploring the Abyss.
string 5
I am attempting to rescue an innocent girl.
string 6
I was thrown in here as punishment for a crime I did not commit.
string 7
Exploring, eh?  Ha, that's a good one.  But if thou dost not wish to speak of thy crime, 'tis not my business to ask.\m
string 8
Ah, a rescue mission, is it?  Should the Baron's guards not be with thee, to aid thee in thy search?  More likely one of them threw thee in here, eh?\m
string 9
Ah, unjustly imprisoned, art thou?  'Tis the usual story, my @SS1, but that is not to say it may not be true in thy case, I suppose.\m
string 10
Thou needst not be ashamed of thy misfortune, @SS1; thou art in the same pot with all of us now.  If thou art to have a chance of surviving in the Abyss for long, thou must learn the lay of the land.
string 11
Indeed, I would be eager to learn of this area.
string 12
I will be able to manage by myself.
string 13
Perhaps thou wilt.  I have heard many say the same as thee, and a few are still alive today.
string 14
Well, what useful information dost thou have?
string 15
Farewell, then.
string 16
First off, I would suggest picking up anything thou dost find that seems of use.  Items here are scarce enough - thou wouldst be well advised to take what thou can.
 Scavenge all you want, but stealing is ill-advised. Most of the Abyss' inhabitants guard jealously the few possessions that they have.
 Battlesites are the best for scavenging. That's why I'm here - A battle took place here not long ago - a battle between the Goblins and the above-worlders.
string 17
What inhabitants are there?
string 18
What was the cause of this battle?
string 19
I do not know.  It is rare that the Baron sends his men into the Abyss.  It must have been important.  Though, by the looks of it, the Goblins defeated them handily.\m
string 20
The Goblins control most of these upper caves.  Two races there are, the Green and the Gray.  If they do not destroy each other, it is not for lack of trying.
 Be thou especially careful of the Gray Goblins.  I was recently imprisoned by them for trespassing.
string 21
It must have been awful!
string 22
How didst thou escape?
string 23
My prison cell was evidently a converted storeroom, for it had a stock of useful items, including a long pole.  Using the pole, I was able to reach a button which opened the door to my cell.  I sneaked away and returned to my people.  I do not think I will venture there again.
string 24
And what of the other inhabitants of the Abyss?
string 25
Tell me of thy people.
string 26
The humans, like thee and myself, have staked out a small area in which we live in relative peace.  Below us are the Mountainmen, and after that I do not know.
string 27
Where is this enclave of humans?
string 28
Are all races but ours hostile?
string 29
A nasty place this is, thou canst be certain of that.  In the parts of the upper caves, uninhabited by Goblins, there are giant spiders and worms.  Our small group is one of the few devoted to peace.\m
string 30
Thou canst find my people by going west from the entrance to the Abyss, and then north. There is a small chasm to jump over, but thou dost seem to be a dextrous @SS1.  Past the chasm is the sign of civilization everywhere throughout the Abyss: the Banner of Cabirus, marked with an ankh, the sign of the Avatar.
 Outside of areas marked with the Banner, thou shouldst watch thyself most carefully.  Most creatures who do not respect Cabirus' legacy are not particularly friendly.
string 31
Perhaps I will seek this area out.
string 32
I thank thee for thy help.
string 33
Good luck in thy travels.
string 34
Greetings again!  I am glad to see that thou hast lived this long. It is not easy for one to survive in the Abyss without the help of others.
string 35
It is easy for me.  I have no need of thy help.
string 36
Well then, what helpful information canst thou tell me?
string 37
Greetings!  Hast thou visited our group?
string 38
Nay, I have not had the time.
string 39
I have not been able to find it.
string 40
Yes, I have.
string 41
Well, 'tis thy decision.  I am sure they would welcome thee.
string 42
Go west from the entrance chamber, past a door, and then north over a chasm. Remember, the Banner of Cabirus -- with the mark of the ankh on it -- is the mark of civilization in the Abyss.
string 43
I am glad to hear it.  If thou growest weary of thy travels, thou art welcome to stay with us.
string 44
I thank thee kindly.
string 45
I thank thee, but my destiny lies elsewhere.
string 46
Ah, 'tis thee again.  Hast thou decided to stay with us?
string 47
I think not.
string 48
No, I have much to do.
string 49
Perhaps I will, for a time.

Aye, I heard of such a thing.  The Abyss isn't a safe place these days, I tell ye.  Perhaps some other of the Folk might know more about that.  Is there anything else I can help ye with?
string 7
Is that so?  Well, the Abyss is nae a place to be searching for fortune. Just a shadow of itself, it is nowadays.  Yet of all the Abyss, we be the ones who still know what fortune is and what to do with it.  Goldthirst, our king, has a hoard to rival any in all of Britannia.

I am looking for treasure.
string 9
I am searching for a monster to destroy.
string 10
Aye, ye would be a miner, eh?  It's a tough job, ye should know that. Don't take it up if ye have not the strength.  Hard it work it is, picking up a rock hammer and smashing boulders to pieces, scraping the rock over and over again, one inch of wall at a time.
string 11
It sounds awful.
string 12
There must be some good points to being a miner.
string 13
Well, it is backbreaking work but the rewards are great.  Gold there is for the hard worker, and I know of no substance better.  Ah, the thrill of feeling one's hammer thud solid rock and suddenly discovering a new vein!
 Go ye to the northern part of these mines and see for yourself the beauty of a gold mine.  But watch yourself - a fearsome monster has been seen in that area, and perhaps even an adventurer such as ye could not handle it.\m
string 14
Is there anything else I can help ye with?
string 15
Ach, ye've come to the right place.  There is no treasure better than gold, and gold there is in abundance in these mines.  In the north parts of these mines especially, ye shall find a beautiful sight. Be careful of the monster that's been seen around those parts, though.
 Now, what else might ye want to know?
string 16
The monster of the mines?  A great boon it would be if ye did defeat it, but I don't know that it can be done.  A fearsome thing it is.  Caught it once out of the corner of me eye, and I don't care to see it again.  It lurks in the north part of these mines.  Ye be careful, if ye truly mean to destroy it.
 We caused a cave-in to block its area from ours, so ye'll have to break your way through it.  Is there anything I can help ye with before ye go off after it?
string 17
What is it like to a be miner?
string 18
Is there great treasure in these mines?
string 19
What of the monster that resides here?
string 20
I would like to trade with thee.

Thank thee, I shall be on my way.

Ach, speaking of help, ye could help an old man greatly by finding me blueprints, if ye could.  Now where was the key to the door to the spiral room? In the golden maze room, methinks.  Ach, yes, it's the golden path ye must follow, or else ye may be poisoned... no, that's the poison potion in the spiral room.  Or was it a flying potion?  Maybe both potions - ach, that's it!
string 17
But which potion is which?
string 18
There is more than one potion there?
string 19
Wait, don't rush me... one potion is green, and the other red.  Or is one red and the other green?  Yes, that's it.  One red and one green, no doubt of it. One of the two is a flying potion and one is poison... or is it the other way around?  Ach, now I've forgotten again.  Oh, that's it - green is good.  Or was it red is rotten?\m
string 20
Well, do your best, won't ye?  And while ye're in the area, if ye happen by me blueprints, bring them back here.  I think I may have left them in the storeroom.  Feel free to help yourself to anything else ye find, though.

Hail Stranger.  What unhappy accident brings thee to the Abyss?
string 2
I have been unjustly accused of a kidnapping.
string 3
I am attemping to rescue a girl.
string 4
I'd rather not speak of it.
string 5
Survival alone is an ambitious goal in the Abyss.   Thou art a brave soul indeed if thou aspirest to aught beyond that.
string 6
In sooth, I grow weak already from hunger.
string 7
My honor demands I pursue my quest against all opposition.
string 8
True, yet perhaps thou might assist me in my task.
string 9
I may succumb to hunger ere long.
string 10
Tell me more of the perils that lie ahead.
string 11
I must prove my innocence at any cost.
string 12
Yet, with thy aid, my chances might improve.
string 13
How dost thou survive amidst such peril?
string 14
Canst tell me aught of what lies ahead?
string 15
I will brook no opposition in my quest.
string 16
Canst thou aid in me in my quest?
string 17
By the bright and glittering stars of heaven, which I have not seen these many years, I wish I had food to give thee.  Yet, I do not.
 I can, however, tell thee something which, as the ancient proverb  states, may feed thee for life.  Mind thee, many have been cast into the Abyss with the empty promises of the hypocrite Almric, and met with a far more grisly demise than mere starvation.\m
string 18
Still, my words are as useless as shouting upwind in a hurricane. More to the point, thou mayest find a pond but a little north of here, where fish will leap from the water  and onto thy pole, more numerous than vultures upon a carcass the  jackals have forsaken.
string 19
If thou dost employ the pole I gave thee, thou shall have all the fish thou may desire.
string 20
I have an extra pole, if thou dost need one.
string 21
I thank thee heartily for thy generosity.
string 22
Thou art kind, but I need it not.
string 23
I wish thee well.  I once believed in noble causes myself. Now I find that just surviving is a noble enough fight. 'Tis easier to drink water from a sieve than escape from the Abyss alive.  If thou dost seek trouble, it shall  find thee 'ere long.
string 24
Farewell, and fortune favor thee.
string 25
I cannot shun the call of duty.
string 26
I have little urge to seek trouble.  I have outlived many in the Abyss by having the good sense to keep myself out of harm's way.  Thou wouldst be wise to do the same.
string 27
Canst thou tell me anything that might aid me in my quest?
string 28
I shall seek advice from one who lives more honorably.  Good day.
string 29
'Tis said that against hunger the gods themselves contend in  vain.  Still, Britannia was not built in a day.  I can tell thee this much, at least: To the north but a short way is a pond, as full of fish as the day is long.
string 30
If thou but put the pole I gave thee to its proper use, thou shalt have fish aplenty.
string 31
'Sblood, that is sage advice, friend.  I will go at once.
string 32
I fear fish do not agree with my stomach.  Goodbye.
string 33
I have an extra fishing pole.  Dost thou want it?
string 34
Thank thee.  I gladly accept thy pole.
string 35
'Tis a kind offer, but I have no need of it.
string 36
I fear I can tell thee little of what lies ahead.  I have found  that those seeking trouble in the nether regions of the Abyss find it eager to make their acquaintance.
string 37
How dost thou survive here, if thou liv'st in fear of thy own shadow?
string 38
Surely thou knowest of thy immediate surroundings?
string 39
Hast thou seen an evil wizard carrying a maiden?
string 40
I take care to keep myself far from trouble's path, and fish for my food.
string 41
Where dost thou fish in this place?
string 42
I have more pressing matters to attend to.
string 43
Hast thou seen an evil wizard carrying a maiden?
string 44
If thou but venture northward, thou shalt soon come across a pond so thick with fish thou couldst walk across without getting thy boots wet.
string 45
Use the pole there, and thou shalt soon have food in abundance.
string 46
I shall.  Thank thee.
string 47
Perhaps I shall later.
string 48
I can give thee my spare fishing pole, if thou dost need it.
string 49
I do need one.  Thank thee kindly.
string 50
Thou art kind, but I need it not.
string 51
No I haven't.  I think I should go now.
string 52
Good bye.
string 53
Thou shouldst learn more of Valor.
string 54
Look, there he is, right behind thee!
string 55
May thy casts be ever fruitful.
string 56
Thank thee, and thine too.
string 57
Art feeling more talkative than when last I saw thee?
string 58
No.  I have no time for the likes of thee.
string 59
Aye.  Who art thou?
string 60
Greetings, friend!  Hast thou caught any fish?
string 61
Aye, more than the sands of the desert.
string 62
Excellent!
string 63
I have not tried.
string 64
Never mind that. Dost thou know aught of an evil wizard nearby?
string 65
Welcome back!  In sooth, thou art lucky to have survived so long, friend.  The Abyss is a place of fearsome peril.
string 66
I am an outcast, trying to survive amidst the fearsome perils of the Abyss. I am surprised thou hast lived so long in spite of thy surly disposition.
string 67
Wouldst thou be interested in a trade?
string 68
Yes.
string 69
No.
string 70
I make thee this offer.
string 71
I demand thou givest me these items.

Thy offer does not interest me
string 77

string 79
That is no trade!
string 80
Art thou attempting to intimidate me into surrendering my possessions?
string 81
Yes, I will deal thee grievous injury if thou dost not comply.
string 82
No, thou mistakest my meaning entirely.
string 83
If thou art desperate enough to steal, I will not oppose thee.

string 1
Hail, stranger.  `Tis indeed a rare pleasure to encounter a new face amongst the denizens of the Abyss.  What hast brought thee hither?
string 2
I must prove I am innocent of a kidnapping.
string 3
I'd rather not dwell on it.
string 4
Suit thyself, friend.  `Tis thy business, not mine.
string 5
A terrible crime, indeed.  I would fain believe thou art innocent of such, for thy face has honor in it. Thou dost wear it like few I have beheld in my many years in the Abyss.  May I help thee in any way?
string 6
Why art thou here?
string 7
Hast thou heard aught of a princess?
string 8
Canst thou tell me aught of this region of the Abyss?
string 9
Like thee, I was unjustly accused of killing a man.  I swear to thee I never struck him.  I merely held him down whilst my brother kicked him.  He should not have treated our sister as he did.  And only a weak man could perish from such slight injuries.
string 10
Methinks thou art guilty as an accomplice.
string 11
Indeed, Almric's justice is a blind archer, oft missing the mark.
string 12
I fear I canst tell thee nothing new.
string 13
It is said the trolls have captured a new dweller in the Abyss.\m
string 14
I have heard there is to be a human sacrifice in Cabirus' old quarters on the lowest level.\m
string 15
A Knight told me that a maiden's body had been found in the lower levels.\m
string 16
In their search for some new advantage over the trolls, the  Knights explore more widely than I.  Mayhap they can tell thee more.
 Still, be careful, lest thou become the next casualty in their senseless battle with the trolls.
string 17
It may be the Knights can tell thee something, for they travel more of the Abyss than I.
string 18
Tell me of these Knights.
string 19
I have problems enough of my own.
string 20
There is much tension on this level of the Abyss.  The Knights inhabit the western area, and a pack of Trolls live in the eastern reaches.
 Even while Sir Cabirus was alive, there was an uneasy peace between them.  After Cabirus' death, there was some strife, as each group attempted to gain power over the other, but these days there is relative peace.\m
string 21
Perhaps the greatest danger in this area now is Rodrick, known as the Chaos Knight.  He lives by the old banquet hall to the north.  He is the foe of both the Knights and the Trolls, but neither has been able to defeat him yet. I hear that Dorna Ironfist has put a price upon his head.
string 22
Thank thee for thy information.
string 23
Hast thou heard news of a captive virgin in the Abyss?
string 24
And methinks thou art a self-righteous ass, who wouldst be  well-suited in the company of the pompous Knights with their overweening morals.  Thy inflated ego wouldst find much company there.
string 25
In sooth, thou speakest with a wisdom beyond thy years,  friend.  What I wouldst not give to teach that tyrant Almric a lesson about justice and honor!  I would deal him a buffeting that would leave his heirs dizzy for generations to come.\m
string 26
Would I could aid thee more, friend, but I know little.  I have heard tell that a maiden is held captive near Cabirus's  quarters far below.  Perhaps the Knights could tell thee more.
string 27
What dost thou know of the Knights?
string 28
I will take thy advice to heart.
string 29
Well met, friend.  How dost thou in thy quest?
string 30
Not well.  Hast thou any news for me?
string 31
Well.  I must soon head to the lower levels.
string 32
In sooth, I am sorry to hear thee  pronounce thy own death sentence.  Good luck, for thou wilt need it if you are  to have any hope of surviving below.
string 33
Canst thou tell me more of this area?
string 34
Not well.  Hast thou any news for me?
string 35
Well.  I must soon head to the lower levels.

Ah, the adventurous life is not for me.  I am content to remain here and work at my craft.

This taper that was lost.
string 11
It is good to see thee again.  Thou wilt go down in the history of our order as the brave soul who found the Taper of Sacrifice that was so long lost.  I thank thee again.
string 12
Our order has been here since the founding of the Colony of the Abyss, and has had many virtuous members.  In the chaos that followed Cabirus' death, we attempted to collect the Talismans of virtue.  However, most were already lost, some supposedly destroyed.
 We did have the Taper of Sacrifice, briefly, but it was taken by some lunatic.  Supposedly the Standard of Honor is somewhere as well, merely awaiting an honorable deed.
string 13
Tell me about this taper.
string 14
We had it, but a while ago a lunatic raided our quarters and stole many things.
string 15
Thank you for the information.
string 16
It is my pleasure to provide information to a member of the order.
string 17
The order has been here since the founding of the Colony of the Abyss, and has had many virtuous members.  More I cannot say to one who is not a member, but thou mayst return to me once thou art inducted and I can tell thee more.
string 18
I shall.
string 19
I doubt I will bother.
string 20
Well, thy path is thine alone to choose,  but I feel it should lie with ours for a while.
string 21
Hast thou heard tell of it, or even seen it, perhaps?
string 22
Yes, I have heard others speak of it.
string 23
That is good news.  Continue to search, and thou mayst find it.
string 24
Yes.  Actually, I have it.
string 25
No.  Canst thou tell me more of it?
string 26
The lunatic who took it fled to the levels above, or so it is told.  Perhaps others have heard tell of him, or can otherwise help thee.
string 27
Farewell.
string 28
It is in thy possession e'en now?  Could thou please show it to me?
string 29
Very well, here it is.
string 30
No.  It would not be appropriate.
string 31
Please, may I see it?
string 32
Please reconsider.
string 33
I beg of thee, let me but look at it.
string 34
Thou art indeed cruel, to deny me a glance at the Taper of Sacrifice.
string 35
That is not the Taper.  Return if thou hast truly found it.
string 36
Ah!  To see the taper again, this is good indeed.
string 37
Ah!  It is good to be bathed in the taper's radiance once more.
string 38
I thank thee for the chance to see the taper again. Now that thou hast found it, it is right that thou dost keep it.  Thou wilt find that the light it produces is quite steady, for it continually sacrifices of itself to produce light for thee.
 Cabirus imbued it with virtue, however, and although it consumes itself constantly to provide light, it is continually replenished as well.
string 39
I shall keep it then, and keep it safe.
string 40
Good luck to thee.
string 41
Thank thee.
string 42
And I thank thee for finding it.
string 43
What dost thou want?
string 44
Nothing.  Farewell.
string 45
Canst thou tell me of Sir Cabirus?  I thought all had abandoned his dream.
string 46
Thou hast uttered sacrilege.  Recant or face my blade.
string 47
I must say what I believe.
string 48
That is as it must be,  as is my slaying thee in the name of my order.
string 49
Thou art quite right.  This culture is splendid.
string 50
That is more appropriate. I trust thou wilt remember this lesson.  Leave now.
string 51
It has been thy misfortune to travel through the other levels of this wasteland, and I am not surprised thou dost think that.  However, we still abide by the dreams of Cabirus and the eight virtues.
string 52
I thought all had abandoned Cabirus' dream.
string 53
They seem to be outdated, and to have failed.  Perhaps  you should admit defeat and start something new.
string 54
No! We work still to bring about a return to the days of the Abyss' glory.  There is hope yet if the races of the colony will  believe again in the virtues and in each other.
 Unfortunately, I think there is little hope.  Most of the dwellers in this colony have forgotten what little they may once have known about its purpose.\m
string 55
Even the most stalwart believers now doubt.  No one remembers the virtues any more.  It is a sad situation.
 Why, several months  ago, someone came from above and stole one of the greatest treasures remaining from Cabirus' days.
string 56
That is tragic.
string 57
Indeed it was.

string 58
What was stolen?
string 59
We lost many small things, mostly from storage.  All of our torches and lanterns were taken.  A few items of food, but mostly light sources, actually.  Quite odd.
 The grave loss was that of the Taper of Sacrifice, though. It was created by Sir Cabirus  himself and imbued with virtue. We placed it in our shrine where we kept a vigil over it. There it remained lit for three years.\m
string 60
But one day a man arrived at one of our guard posts. He ranted and raved, but we let him in, as common courtesy dictates, of  course.  He started running about and grabbing candles and such. We were all too shocked to respond.  Then he grabbed the Taper itself and ran off.
 By the time we were in armor and ready to give chase we had lost him. A tragedy it was.
string 61
Perhaps I shall seek this Taper thou dost speak of.
string 62
I wish thee good luck.  Seek it above, for that is where we believe the lunatic came from.
string 63
I believe that I have found this Taper.
string 64
It must be hard living in a wild place like this.
string 65
It is indeed tiresome.  But Knights of the Crux are not defeated, regardless of the difficulty of their task.

In better times thou wouldst have seen our true glory.  The  splendor of our domain and righteousness of our cause were great indeed.

string 9
What was it like before?
string 10
Perhaps it should never have been built.
string 11
It was wonderful.  We would visit the ceremonial hall every day.  Sometimes we would go below and challenge the Golem to a test of might.  There were marvelous banquets. The Mayors of towns throughout Britannia would come to marvel at our achievements. Now none can survive the dangers of this place long enough to reach us.
string 12
Well, I was able to reach thee.
string 13
A test of might?
string 14
What have you done to make it better?
string 15
Well, thou art an exception, the first outsider I've seen in this place in years.
string 16
Thou didst speak of a test of might.
string 17
Have you done anything to improve the area?
string 18
A Golem resides on an island surrounded by lava in the land of the Seers.
 We would take our swords and shields, leap onto the island, and battle the Golem.  It was indestructable, but honorable and valorious.  Though it could not be destroyed, it would congratulate thee if thou didst fight well.
 If thou wert good enough it would sometimes reward thee.
string 19
The Seers live below, correct?
string 20
Yes.  If the Golem still exists, he would be there.
string 21

We have sent Knights on many quests to make certain things better. All met with grave perils.  Some met with success. Some never returned.
string 23
I am glad to hear that some of the quests were successful.
string 24
Tell me about those who never returned.
string 25
We heard rumors that a powerful mage on the seventh level of the Abyss was kidnapping and killing  people.  We sent a party of our most valorous Knights to investigate. They never returned.  We hope to  mount an expedition to investigate, but our resources are limited.
string 26
Perhaps this is the same mage I seek.

I will investigate this mage myself.

Thank thee for thy time, and farewell.

Be thou most careful!  If our Knights were unable to defeat him, he must be powerful indeed.

I thank thee for thy time.
string 9
My pleasure.
string 10
Ah, yes, this area is wonderfully designed.  We created much of it ourselves, with some help from the artisans of Minoc and the Mountainfolk.  There are many regions of interest.  Although the Abyssal colony has only existed a short time, it is filled with wonders to match any found in Britannia.
string 11
Canst thou tell me of these wonders?
string 12
It does not seem very wondrous to me.
string 13
I have just begun to explore its beauty.
string 14
In the northeast corner of the level is the Puzzle of the Bullfrog, made by a Mountainfolk craftswoman who had a love of frogs.
 To the northwest is the Maze of Silas, a stoneworker and lover of deceptive walls.
 Beyond the maze is the door of precious levers, which opens the gateway to the resting place of one of our order.
 There is a water-filled area to the west of the Abyss' volcanic core. The waterfall is something to see.
string 15
Tell me about the Puzzle of the Bullfrog.
string 16
Tell me about the Maze of Silas.
string 17
Tell me about the door of precious levers.
string 18
Tell me about the watery area.
string 19
I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
string 20
Past the puzzle in the northeast there is an entrance to the tombs below.  To reach the entrance, one must traverse an area surrounded by water.  It is said that by using the levers and buttons in the area, one may create a safe path to the other side.  It has been years since the puzzle was created, though, and its solution is now lost.  The only clue I know of is that the wand found there will restore the puzzle to its pristine state.
string 21
I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
string 22
The Maze of Silas is now infested with pests and littered with debris and bones, but there are said to be other things in the maze as well -- hidden chambers and items of some value. The locations of these chambers and items are unknown now, however, so what they contain I cannot reveal to thee.
string 23
I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
string 24
Near the volcano's shaft is a set of falls leading to two pools.
 One pool is very hard to reach, at least from our domain. But 'tis said it is simple to get there from the Lair of the Lizard-Folk. Would that one among us could speak their tongue and learn the easier route.
 The second pool is in a secluded spot near a fishing run south of the Abyss' central shaft.
string 25
I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
string 26
The puzzle of precious levers is beyond the maze.  Although the members of our knighthood will not be specific, it is believed to be in a concealed area.
 The puzzle itself was built to guard the stores of the old government of the Abyss.  Now, however, not one of us could tell thee what lies beyond the closed door.\m
string 27
The workings of the levers are not understood, but 'tis said that their secrets can be gleaned through careful examination of the artifacts of our order.
 I have not the patience for such research, but perhaps one who does will solve the mystery.
string 28
I thought I had already told thee of that.\m
string 29
They are indeed a vicious and dangerous race.  I would call them indecent, but that was not Cabirus' way, and I strive not to make it mine.
 They are, truth be told, honorable in their own way.  Only a few of them still cling to any shreds of the Abyss' purpose, though.  Some have reverted to their natural, combative state.  They are monsters, and powerful ones, at that.
string 30
How can one pass through their realm safely?
string 31
I suppose I should be ready to fight.
string 32
Ready, yes, but not eager.
string 33
I can handle them.
string 34
Part of a knight's goal is to be a good fighter, it is true.  But a good fighter does not rejoice in a battle for its own sake.
 Thy blade is an ally only when it is used with honor and justice. When it is used for needless bloodshed, it stains thy honor and the honor of thy order.
 Do not fight for the sake of killing.  Fight for thy life, the life of those thou art sworn to defend, and to eliminate those that threaten our realm.  Fighting for the sake of blood is a short road to death.
string 35
Thou needst not fight continually to survive their realm. In the south, where the main meeting hall of the Trolls used to be, there are still Trolls who respect Cabirus' purpose.  They can tell thee more of the realm.  Beware the Dark Trolls - they are more powerful even than the normal ones.\m
string 36
Also beware the northern parts of their realm, for they have been invaded by spiders, headlesses, and worse.  These monsters will provide enough trouble, so don't attack Trolls unless they attack thee first.  Thou wilt have enough trouble staying alive without picking fights.
string 37
We came here from Jhelom.  The fairest town in Britannia, that I can say with certainty.  Been to them all I have, and none compare.
string 38
Thou dost speak truly.
string 39
It certainly is a fine town.
string 40
Thou dost think so?  I disagree.
string 41
The colony of the Abyss was an achievement unparalleled in recent times.  Eight cultures mixing in one environment, and getting along splendidly.  We had some banquets that were spectacular, I tell thee.  They rivaled the best of parties that even Jhelom could offer. We would all gather just to the northeast of here in the banquet hall.  We would stay up all night -- though of course it is hard to tell down here -- and recount tales of our homelands, our rituals, and our friends.\m
string 42
Now all we do is fight for food and space.  Truly the death of Cabirus was the death of the Colony of the Stygian Abyss.  Still, we try, for it is all we can do to honor his legacy and dream.
string 43
Perhaps the inhabitants of Jhelom were not perfect, but they were certainly more courteous than thee.
string 44
Farewell.
string 45
I make thee this offer.
string 46
I demand thou givest me these items.
string 47
Excuse me, I must think about this deal.
string 48
I do not wish to barter any further.
string 49
Farewell.
string 50
I accept thy offer.
string 51
No, I do not like this deal.
string 52
Dost thou take me for a fool?
string 53
I am weary of this haggling.
string 54
Surely thou art joking.
string 55
Dost thou intend to rob me?
string 56
Yes, I must.
string 57
No, thou dost misunderstand me.
string 58
If thou dost insist, thou canst have them.
string 59
No! Thou shalt not take them!

I am almost tempted to spare thee so that thou canst tell thy companions of my power.

I see that thou art more interested in conversing than in fighting.  A true warrior thou art not.

He lives in the north part of the banquet hall, in the area with the dark marbled walls  and the sloped halls.  Thou shalt find him there!\m
string 4
We fought, but I was not able to defeat him.
string 5
He is a tough opponent, and quite strong. Find advantageous terrain and move often to keep him from simply overpowering thee.  Watch out for his slash.  Good luck to thee.\m

I think so.

@SS1, Thou art a member of my order.  Thou too dost strive to uphold the ideals of honor espoused by our order.  Thou dost understand the virtues, and understand the ways of knighthood.  Please listen to my tale.
string 11
Good @SS1, thou dost seem valorous and just, well equipped for the grave peril of the Abyss, and ready to brave the dangers of this area.  Please listen to my tale.
string 12
I would be happy to hear thy story.
string 13
'Tis not a happy story, @SS1, but I shall tell it all the same.\m
string 14
I shall.  Begin it at once.
string 15
I am quite busy.  Perhaps some other time.
string 16
Sir Rodrick was once a member of our order, but abandoned the principles of our order and now calls himself the Chaos Knight, terrorizing the entire northern area.  Since to attack one with many would be dishonorable, our leader Dorna picked me to defeat him in single combat.\m
string 17
When I reached the old banquet hall to the north, I was suddenly attacked by Rodrick, who leaped from a ledge above me and took me off guard.  He attacked relentlessly, and although I hit him several times, my own blows did little to slow him or curb his apparent anger.  He taunted me continuously as we fought, and would not listen as I attempted to reason with him.\m
string 18
I am surprised that thou art still alive.
string 19
How did the battle finally end?
string 20
After several minutes I was bleeding from several wounds and thinking my time was up.  In desperation, I flung my sword at him.  He blocked it easily, but the distraction allowed me to run from him.\m
string 21
So that is my story.  I can not return to my home until I have eliminated Rodrick and restored our order's honor, but it will be some time now before I am capable of fighting.  So I wait here, far from the Trolls and other pests, gathering my strength before I head off again.
string 22
Thou art going to attack him again?
string 23
Surely thou art mad.
string 24
My honor is my life, and he has stolen it by defaming our order and defeating me.\m
string 25
That is wise of thee.
string 26
I must defeat him to restore my honor and that of my order, it is true, but a true knight approaches battles with strength and wits, and even with my wits it is clear that I am not now ready to fight him.\m
string 27
Please return, and help me.
string 28
I am quite disappointed with thy lack of compassion.
string 29
Sir
string 30

string 31
Noble @SS2, I implore thee to hear it, for it is of great import, and dire consequences arise from it.
string 32
I have not the time.  I will return if I am able,  but I have pressing business to attend to first.
string 33
Very well, but tell it quickly.
string 34
I'd give the rest of my right arm for a chance to take that rogue on again.  He'd find out what sort of Knight I am.
string 35
Thou shouldst probably rest.
string 36
Thou art certainly right.
string 37
Perhaps I can defeat him.
string 38
That would be quite honorable of thee.
string 39
Let us join forces to defeat the villain.
string 40
I should get well first, for I would not wish to be a burden on thee.
string 41
If thou dost meet the rogue and defeat him, it would not only bring great honor to thee but also perhaps save my life.
string 42
I will seek him out.
string 43
Farewell.
string 44
@GS8!  I am pleased beyond measure to see thee again.  I have told all here of thy exploits and they are as thankful as I am.
 Ah, by the way, as I made my way home, I happened across this scroll, and thought it might be useful to thee in thy travels.  Please take it as a token of my thanks.
string 45
\mI will leave it here for thee.
string 46
A hearty greeting to thee, @GS8.  It is good to see that thou dost allow precious time to converse with thy old friends.  Still, perhaps it is time for thee to travel on and find new challenges to overcome.

A pleasure to meet thee again, @GS8.  I've no time to talk at the moment, as I must return home to rejoin my companions. I would be most pleased to talk with thee once I am there.

string 1
Greetings, traveler.  What brings thee to an area of the Abyss as perilous as this?  Art thou upon a quest, as I myself am?
string 2
What is thy quest?
string 3
No, I am not on a quest.
string 4
Many years ago, I began research into methods for turning lower metals into gold.  During the course of my research, I discovered a new and better method that depends on a particular, very rare substance.  I quest to find more of this substance.
string 5
Why is this method so much better?
string 6
Tell me of this substance.
string 7
zanium
string 8
the principal reagent
string 9
When I started, existing methods required a great many reagents to operate, and could produce only a fraction of an ounce of gold for each pound of lower metal.
 The new method requires a much smaller quantity of reagents and produces much more gold.  However, @SS1 is rare, and I have been able to locate only trace amounts of it.
string 10
Tell me of this substance.
string 11
How is the mineral collected?
string 12
Tell me of the mining area.
string 13
Where hast thou located the reagent?
string 14
It is a blue rock-like mineral called zanium.  The only samples I have found have been on this floor of the Abyss in tunnels with rough-hewn walls.  I believe there is a mining area in the southwest where there may be larger deposits, but I cannot gain access to it.
string 15
How is the new method better?
string 16
How is this mineral collected?
string 17
Tell me of the mining area.
string 18
Zanium has the property of being self-attractive.  Deposits near the surface can be collected merely by walking over them while carrying a sample.  In an underground environment such as this, if there is zanium present, there is likely to be some near the the surface.  Thus, in a sense, it is collected automatically.
string 19
Tell me of this mining area.
string 20
Who might know more about the mine?
string 21
Then perhaps I can help thee.
string 22
I do not know much.  There is a small room in the southwestern region that is labelled "mine dispatch chamber."  There appear to be some controls, but I know not how to operate them.
string 23
Is there anyone who would know about the controls?
string 24
How is this mineral collected?
string 25
Now that thou dost mention it, yes, there is one who may know something.  One of those frightful ghouls in the catacombs used to be foreman in the mining sector.  No ghoul has spoken to me since I killed one of them in self-defense.  Perhaps thou couldst assist me?
string 26
What assistance dost thou need?
string 27
I am sorry, but I am unable to help thee.
string 28
If thou couldst talk to the miner ghoul and discover how to operate the dispatch chamber I would be most grateful.  In addition, if thou wouldst enter the mining area, brave its dangers and collect at least eighty samples of zanium, I would reward thee with a large gold nugget created from lead.
string 29
I shall get thee information about the controls.
string 30
I will bring thee the zanium.
string 31
Well, if thou dost change thy mind, speak with me again.  Farewell.
string 32
Wait!  I will help thee.
string 33
Farewell.
string 34
Wouldst thou?  Thou art indeed a kind soul!  Take this small sample.  Carry it through the mine, and it shall attract more of its kind.
string 35
I will leave it on the floor here for thee.
string 36
Farewell.
string 37
I thank thee kindly.  Speak to me after thou hast obtained the pertinent information.  Farewell.
string 38
Wait, I shall get the zanium.
string 39
Farewell.
string 40
I see.  Then thou art an intrepid explorer indeed, to brave such depths as this.
string 41
Though I have no quest, do tell me of thine.
string 42
Indeed.  And I must continue.  Farewell.
string 43
Farewell.
string 44
Hast thou obtained the information I require?
string 45
Yes, I have.
string 46
No, I have not.
string 47
I have decided to get the zanium.
string 48
Excellent!  What are the settings for the controls?
string 49
The settings are...
string 50
Oh, sorry.  I do not have the settings.
string 51
'Tis a shame.  Return when thou hast it.
string 52
726
string 53
I thank thee very much.  I shall attempt to enter the mine.
string 54
I thank thee for the information.  It was indeed correct, but I was unable to retrieve the zanium because of numerous apparitions in the mine area.  Wouldst thou retrieve it?
string 55
Yes.
string 56
No, I cannot.
string 57
Well, if thou dost reconsider, let me know.
string 58
The information thou didst give me was incorrect.  Dost thou wish to correct it?
string 59
Yes, I do.
string 60
No, I do not.  Farewell.
string 61
I shall get the zanium.
string 62
Hast thou found eighty samples of zanium?
string 63
Yes, I have.
string 64
No, I have not.
string 65
Excellent!  May I have them please?
string 66
Here they are.
string 67
Oh, sorry.  I don't have them.
string 68
Very well.  Return when thou hast found it.

string 75

string 76
I said it would be an hour.  Come back in @SI6C2 @SS3.
string 77
Here is thy reward.  I thank thee again.
string 78
Hello again, traveler.  How may I help thee?
string 79
Please tell me of thy quest.
string 80
I was just leaving
string 81
Hast thou reconsidered?  Wilt thou help me after all?
string 82
Yes.  What dost thou need?
string 83
No.  I cannot help thee.
string 84
Hast thou reconsidered?  Wilt thou get the zanium?
string 85
Yes, I shall.
string 86
No.  Farewell.
string 87
I must thank thee again for retrieving the zanium.  I am sorry, but I must excuse myself, as I am still busy with experiments.
string 88
I am sorry.  Here are thy eighty samples of zanium.
string 89
I will go then and retrieve more zanium.

What didst thou do before the collapse?

Ho, adventurer!  I have been looking for one like thee.  Hast thou made the acquaintance of an adventurer known as Zak?
string 2
I have not met such a man.
string 3
Indeed I have.  He lives above with the lizardmen.
string 4
Zak?
string 5
I am sorry to hear it.  I have not been able to find another candelabra like the one he stole from me.
string 6
I am glad to hear that!  Perhaps I will be able to retrieve my candelabra from him now.
string 7
I don't know his real name, but he has come to be known simply as Zak.  He was a Knight, I understand, before finding something in his adventures that caused him to lose his sanity.  Recently he wandered by and made off with my candelabra.  I don't expect ever to see it again.  I hear that he also stole from the Knights some candle that they value highly.
string 8
I've never met him.
string 9
Indeed I have met him!  He resides above us, on the level of the lizardmen.
string 10
Hello, @GS8!  I thank thee again for telling me of the whereabouts of Zak.

Oh, hello again.  Hast thou perhaps found Zak?

I see thou art an adventurer.  Art thou here searching for a Golem?
string 2
Yes, I am.  Canst thou direct me to it?
string 3
I search no longer, for I have defeated it!
string 4
No, I'm not interested in thy Golem.
string 5
What is this Golem thou dost speak of?
string 6
Well then, I wish thee luck with whatever else thou searchest for.
string 7
Thou canst find him by heading west from the central chamber as far as thou canst and then turning left.  He's on the island surrounded by lava.  Be warned - he is quite tough!
string 8
The Golem was created by the Seer Lerin at the Knights' request as a test of valor.  No Knights have come down to test themselves against him for quite a while now, but they used to frequently.  I believe that a suitable prize awaits the one who can defeat him.

I'm sure I can defeat him!

Hello, adventurer.  I don't suppose thou canst help me.
string 2
Well, what is thy problem?
string 3
No, I probably can't.
string 4
I've lost the ability to levitate, so I can no longer cross lava with ease.  I need to cross some lava, and the only thing that could now help me would be a pair of dragonskin boots.  Canst thou help me?
string 5
Certainly, here you go.
string 6
Sorry, I can't help you.
string 7
I don't know what you're talking about.
string 8
I thank thee kindly!
string 9
I'm sorry, but those don't look like dragonskin boots to me.
string 10
Oh, here they are.
string 11
Sorry, I don't have any.
string 12
That's too bad.  I could really use a pair.
string 13
It is said that dragonskin boots allow the wearer to walk over lava without pain.  Do you have a pair that you can spare?
string 14
Yes I do, here they are.
string 15
No, I'm sorry.
string 16
Hello again!  Again, I thank thee kindly for the boots!  Good luck in your travels.
string 17
I thank thee for thy kind wishes.
string 18
Thou art welcome, but now I need the boots myself.
string 19
Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou decided to help me?
string 20
What was the help thou wert seeking?
string 21
Yes, here are the boots thou seekest.
string 22
No, I still cannot.
string 23
But I still have need of them!  I will give them back to thee when I am done with them.
string 24
Very well.
string 25
How long will you be needing them?
string 26
Not more than two or three months.  I thank thee again!
string 27
I make thee this offer.
string 28
I demand thou givest me these items.
string 29
Excuse me, I must think about this deal.

Hello, adventurer.  Hast thou seen my friend Gurstang?
string 2
Yes.
string 3
No.
string 4
Who?
string 5
I am glad to hear it!  He must have told thee the code word he was searching for, then!
string 6
I'm afraid not.
string 7
Indeed he did.
string 8
I may have been mistaken.  Perhaps I did not meet this Gurstang.
string 9
That seems quite unlikely.  Perhaps thou mistook another mage for my friend Gurstang.  If thou truly findest Gurstang, please   let me know!
string 10
Yes?  And what was it?
string 11
Other...
string 12
I don't think I should tell thee.
string 13
I may be able to help thee if thou tellst me the word.
string 14
Well then, it was...
string 15
Nay, I will not tell it to thee.
string 16
Hmm.  I begin to think that perhaps thou hast not met Gurstang after all.  I hope that thou wilt tell me the word he gives thee if thou dost see him.
string 17
Folanae
string 18
Hmm... @PS-2, thou sayest.  No, that doesn't seem quite right.  Art thou quite sure that was the word?
string 19
Maybe not.  Perhaps the word was...
string 20
I thought it was.
string 21
I may be mistaken.
string 22
I would suggest that thou dost find Gurstang again and make sure of the code word this time.
string 23
Hmm... Folanae, thou sayest...\p perhaps...\p Yes, that must be it! The puzzle is becoming clearer!
string 24
What puzzle?
string 25
That's great.  Now, I must be going.
string 26
Gurstang was searching for clues to the Key of Truth, a fabled object which has long been lost.  Apparently, it is no longer in this world, so Gurstang and I looked for possible ways to bring it here from whatever world it is now in.  The word that Gurstang found is an important clue.
string 27
What is its meaning?
string 28
We were of the opinion that praying at a shrine might bring it back.  I would guess that the library might contain information regarding which shrine must be used.  I suspect that any tome mentioning Gurstang's word, "Folanae," would hold the final clue to regaining the key.
string 29
I will seek out this information.
string 30
Good luck!
string 31
Where is this library?
string 32
It is located in the old Academy, in the northwest.  Enter the Academy's main hall and head west; it should be on thy left. Good luck!
string 33
That's too bad.  I wonder what happened to him.  I hope that he has not been killed, or worse!
string 34
My friend Gurstang, a fellow Seer.  He went downstairs a few months ago and I haven't seen him since.
string 35
Oh, that Gurstang!  I just ran into him.
string 36
That's terrible!  I haven't seen him.
string 37
What was he doing down there?
string 38
He was on a search for the fabled Key of Truth.  He must have fallen into the hands of Tyball, the wizard below.
string 39
I believe I have seen him.
string 40
I shall let thee know if I find him.
string 41
Please do.  I fear for his safety.
string 42
Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found the Key of Truth?
string 43
Yes, I have found it.
string 44
Not yet.
string 45
Canst thou repeat what thou said earlier of it?
string 46
Hello, @GS8!  Art thou not interested to learn the significance of the word Gurstang gave thee?
string 47
Yes, please tell me.
string 48
Not particularly.
string 49
Hello, @GS8!  Hast thou found my friend Gurstang?
string 50
Yes, I have discovered him.
string 51
I'm afraid not.
string 52
I knew it could be found!  I hope that the Key aids thee in thy quest.
string 53
I wish thee luck and speed in finding it.
string 54
Thank thee, I will continue on my quest to find it.
string 55
How didst thou say it could be found?
string 56
I think that praying at a shrine must have something to do with it.  I would look in the library for a book that contains "Folanae," the word that Gurstang discovered, for a clue.
string 57
I will look there.  Thank thee!
string 58
Where is this library again?
string 59
Congratulations on finding the Key of Truth!  I hope that it will prove an aid to thee.

A new adventurer in our midst, eh?  Perhaps thou wouldst like to increase thy magical powers?
string 2
I surely would.
string 3
No, thank thee.
string 4
Yes, I now see that thou art not as powerful as I first thought.  I'm sure thou hast not the power to use a Vas runestone anyways.
string 5
Thou art right.  Farewell.
string 6
I certainly could use a Vas runestone!
string 7
Well then, here's how to obtain one.
string 8
Well, listen carefully, for I shall tell thee how to obtain a Vas runestone, the most powerful runestone there is.
string 9
Go to the meeting hall to the east and shoot right between the eyes.  Then put an emerald on each of the four platforms in the corners, walk back to the middle of the room, and press the gray button.
string 10
Thank thee, I shall follow thy instructions carefully.
string 11
Thy instructions are most confusing.
string 12
'Tis true - they are.  'Tis also true that if thou canst not follow them, thou art perhaps not worthy to reap the reward gained by doing so.  Good luck.
string 13
Thou hast gained the runestone already.  Thou hast no further need of me. Use thy new powers as thou wilt!
string 14
Hello again, adventurer!  Hast thou decided to seek greater magical power after all?
string 15
Yes, I have need of it.
string 16
No, I still desire no greater power.
string 17
Very well, then.
string 18
Hello again!  Wert thou successful in finding what thou sought?
string 19
Indeed I was.  Thank thee for the directions.
string 20
No, thy instructions were too confusing.
string 21
No, but I will continue to search.

Good luck!

Well done.  I wish thee luck with thy new power.

Hail, stranger!  Hast thou come to enroll in the Academy?
string 2
Yes, I have.
string 3
No, I have had enough schooling.
string 4
The Academy?  I was not aware of such an institution.
string 5
That is too bad, for it has been closed for years now.
string 6
'Twould not matter in any case, for the Academy has been closed for many a year.
string 7
I am not surprised, for the Academy is now closed, and few remember its days of glory.
string 8
'Tis a pity that thou wert not here when Sir Cabirus was still alive.  The Abyss was a thriving settlement, and our Academy was the center of it.  Nobody seems to be interested in the higher arts any longer, though.
string 9
Indeed, simply to survive here is quite a feat.
string 10
But I am!  Canst thou assist me in my search for knowledge?
string 11
This is so.  Since the Academy was closed, most of us have been content merely to eke out a meager existence in some small corner of the Abyss.
string 12
And the Academy?  Is there aught left of it now?
string 13
I do not blame thee.  The Abyss is truly a dangerous place.
string 14
I am afraid our once proud Academy has been infested by creatures who have no interest in the knowledge and wisdom contained there. To them, its halls offer notihg more than convenient shelter.  It pains my heart to think of the Academy's decline from the days of old.
string 15
What knowledge may one find in the Academy?
string 16
I sympathize with thee.  Surely 'twas once a wondrous place.
string 17
Perhaps one day the Abyss will return to its former glory, but I begin to doubt it more and more.  Ah, what I would not give to see the Academy restored!
string 18
I doubt it will happen in our lifetime.
string 19
I would not give up hope.
string 20
It may be that thou art right.  All I can do is hope.
string 21
I wish thee luck.  Farewell!
string 22
Does anything remain of the Academy's former days?
string 23
It is possible that in the old library of the Academy thou mayst be able to find some useful information.  But be careful - many monsters inhabit the Academy these days.
string 24
Where is this library?
string 25
Thank thee for thy help.
string 26
Enter the great hall of the Academy and head west.  The library will be on thy left.  Perhaps some of its books, and the knowledge contained therein, are still intact.
string 27
Thank thee.
string 28
Greetings again!  Hast thou discovered aught in the area of the Academy?
string 29
No, nothing of any import.
string 30
Nothing remains of its former glory.
string 31
It is somewhat dilapidated, but perhaps it can yet be renovated.
string 32
I am sorry to hear that.  I fear that the best days of the Academy are past.
string 33
Perhaps there is hope yet.  When thy quest is done, perhaps thou canst return to see us restore the Academy to its former state of glory.

Hello, adventurer.  I have a book I must deliver to my fellow mage Morlock, but I have not the time to give it to him in person.  Wilt thou take it to him for me?

I don't have the time either.

In what way might I benefit from such an act?

Yes, I promise.

Then do so, please!

I thank thee very much.
string 25
I should have known better than to trust thee a second time. Perhaps thou shouldst run less dangerous errands in the future.

A little curious, wert thou?  I expected as much, to be honest.  It is well that I happened to have a second copy of the book.  Please, be more careful with this one!

Vilus?  I have not heard of such a person.

That I cannot do!
string 11
Why art thou afraid of me?
string 12
I am afraid thou didst misunderstand me.
string 13
Dost thou toy with me?  I thought thou wert in league with Vilus, a mage almost as evil as he is insane, and almost as insane as he is powerful!
string 14
And so I am.  Prepare to die!
string 15
No, I am not.  Tell me of this Vilus.
string 16
Vilus used to be a Seer like the rest of us.  A brilliant mage he was, but perhaps too much so for his own good.  While exploring a method of casting powerful magic without runestones, he was overtaken by insanity.
string 17
And where is he now?
string 18
Whether he be alive or dead, I know not.  He took over the caves to the northeast, filling them with vicious creatures and devious traps.  No sane person ventures there any longer, least of all myself.  Wilt thou run an errand there for me?
string 19
Assuredly.  I have no fear of this Vilus.
string 20
Not if it as dangerous as thou sayst.
string 21
What wouldst thou have me do?
string 22
Oh, it's not really as dangerous as all that.  A few creatures here and there... nothing that thou couldst not deal with easily.
string 23
Perhaps I will run this errand for thee.
string 24
And what dost thou want done in this place?
string 25
Vilus took a powerful book from the Library and failed to return it.  It is named "On the Properties of Runestones."  Return it to me and I shall teach thee to use thy magical abilities to their fullest.
string 26
It is as good as done.
string 27
Wait!  I have it right here.
string 28
I have no time for this errand.
string 29
I thank thee greatly.  Good luck in thy travels.
string 30
I am disappointed to hear that.  If thou dost happen to find the book anyway, please let me know.
string 31
I am glad to hear it!  I am sure that if thou wert allied with Vilus, I would be dead already.
string 32
Who is this Vilus?
string 33
Ah, 'tis thee again.  From a distance I mistook thee for one of Vilus' servants.  Hast thou found "On the Properties of Runestones" for me yet?
string 34
Yes, here it is.
string 35
Nay, it has eluded me.
string 36
I am sure that that fiend Vilus has hidden it most deviously.  I wish that I could aid thee in thy search!
string 37
Marvelous!  I hope that it was not too much trouble to retrieve it.
string 38
He snaps his fingers and you are briefly bathed in a blue glow.
string 39
There, thou shouldst find that thy spellcasting skill is greater now.
string 40
I'm afraid that this is not the book I requested.
string 41
Perhaps this is it.
string 42
Sorry, I do not have thy book.
string 43
Yes?  Where is it?

Aaah!  What's that?\p...  Oh, thou didst startle me.  I was in the midst of a vivid dream, having just used some incense.  I had a terrible vision of a great demon.
string 2
What didst thou dream of this demon?
string 3
Using incense caused thee to have this dream?
string 4
I did not mean to startle thee.
string 5
It was horrible!  The demon is more powerful than thou canst imagine.  I do not think he can be defeated by any mortal.
string 6
Thou speakst as if it were real, not just in a dream.
string 7
How didst thou come to have this dream?
string 8
This was no ordinary dream, but one dreamt after burning incense.   Incense causes one to have vivid dreams, and they are always true in some way.
 Simply pass a block of incense over a torch to produce the smoke which, when inhaled, will cause one to dream.
 If my dream was of a demon, then some demon truly is threatening us.
string 9
I hope for our sake thou art wrong.
string 10
Is there nothing that can be done?
string 11
According to my dream, the demon is too powerful to be killed by any mortal. It would have to forced into leaving this world by some other means. I hope it can be done!
string 12
If I meet a demon, I will keep thy advice in mind.
string 13
Thank thee for thy time.
string 14
Ah, 'tis thee again.
string 15
Thou dost seem more relaxed than the first time we met.
string 16
Hast thou any more information about the demon of your dream?
string 17
I have not used incense since the time of our meeting, so I have had no more dreams of demons.  Perhaps I am better off - that dream was truly terrifying.

Ah, hello there.  Art thou a mage, as I am?
string 2
I dabble in the mystical arts occasionally.
string 3
Yes, I consider myself to be a mage.
string 4
I prefer to solve the problems I encounter without resorting to magic.
string 5
Then I am sure thou wouldst be interested in my research.  I am exploring the properties of mantras and shrines.
string 6
What hast thou found?
string 7
Perhaps my research could benefit thee, although thou couldst probably not understand it.  I am exploring the properties of mantras and shrines.
string 8
What hast thou found?
string 9
It was long thought that the shrines of the Abyss served only to increase one's ability at some skill.  But I have found that this is not necessarily the case.  Apparently, some mantras exist that will produce objects, or dispense information.
string 10
What mantras are these?
string 11
Thy research sounds fascinating.
string 12
I have not been able to discover any specific mantras with these properties. However, it is said that there is a mantra which will direct one to a powerful object.  The mantra has been divided into three parts, which must be reassembled to produce the original word.  The tale is from long ago, so I know not its veracity.
string 13
Hast thou knowledge of any other mantras?
string 14
Thank thee for thy time.
string 15
Thou art quite welcome.  Good luck in thy quests!
string 16
Sadly, I have no further knowledge of individual mantras.  I hope that my research has been of some use to thee, however.
string 17
We shall see.
string 18
It certainly has.  I thank thee kindly.
string 19
Hail, fellow mage!
string 20
Greetings, adventurer.
string 21
@SS1  How may I help thee?
string 22
I would like to know more of mantras.
string 23
I thank thee, but I need thy help no longer.
string 24
Unfortunately, I know of no other legendary mantras other than the one of which I told thee previously - the mantra which has been divided into three parts.  Magical research is a long and arduous process, and only rarely does one discover truly interesting information.
string 25
I thank thee for the help.

Please, please, one at a time!
string 29
I'm sorry.  Canst thou identify this?
string 30
Oh, never mind.
string 31
Here thou art.
string 32
I cannot afford thy services.
string 33
That's the Sword of Justice, one of the Talismans of Virtue created by Cabirus.  Not too many finer weapons wilt thou see.
string 34
That is the Ring of Humility.  It has no magic powers, but still the Virtuous energy given it by Cabirus is undeniable.
string 35
That is the Shield of Valor, one of Cabirus' Talismans. It will protect your front side admirably, but 'twill not help thee if thou dost turn thy back on an enemy.
string 36
That is the Taper of Sacrifice, one of the Talismans of Virtue created by Cabirus.  Its light may not be great, but it will never fail thee.
string 37
That is the Taper of Sacrifice, one of the Talismans of Virtue created by Cabirus.  Its light may not be great, but it will never fail thee.
string 38
Ah, that is the Cup of Wonder.  'Twas fashioned by Sir Cabirus himself, as one of his Talismans.  Beautiful, is it not?
string 39
The Wine of Compassion that is, one of Cabirus' Talismans. It was of a fine vintage, but perhaps it is past its prime now.
string 40
That is the Book of Honesty, one of the Talismans of Cabirus. It is said that the power of truth contained in the tome is such that its pages cannot be torn out.
string 41
That is the Standard of Honor, one of Cabirus' Talismans. It was to be a symbol of courage throughout all Britannia.
string 42
Will there be anything else?
string 43
I make thee this offer.
string 44
I demand thou givest me these items.

I'm here to rescue my brother. He's in the prisons.

Several cells lie to the north and west of here.  He rots in one of those.
string 17
Who holds him prisoner?
string 18
I wish I could help thee, but I must solve my own problems.
string 19
He is in the clutches of the evil wizard who dominates this area.  My brother came to explore this place months ago and I have not heard from him since.  I believe he has run afoul of this vile and violent mage.
string 20
Tell me of this wizard.
string 21
If I find him, I shall set him free.
string 22
Rumor has it that he is the reason no one can cast spells on this level. Also, he uses monsters as henchmen to guard the way to his lair.  But I have figured out how to get by these guards!
string 23
How can one get past the guards?
string 24
Seeing the shape thou art in, I shall make my own plans.
string 25
A medallion of passage!  I had one but I lost it while in battle in the haunted mines to the southeast. Now I am too weak to recover it, and just wish to return home. But perhaps thou...
string 26
Say no more!  I will seek out these mines now.
string 27
Thou dost not wish to hear all I would tell thee?  Well, hear this, for it may prevent thee from ending up like I have.  A medallion of passage is needed to pass by the guards. It lies in the haunted mines in the southeast.  Now go, if thou art determined to brave the perils of these caves!
string 28
Is that so?  Well, farewell, then.  I will rejoin my comrades up above.

I seek to free a kidnapped girl.
string 3
I must defeat the wizard Tyball.
string 4
Well, watch thyself.  There are nasty spiders all around. My friend was just killed by one, some distance to the north. He had a key that would allow one to enter a place of some importance. There one might find an item that allows the owner to get through Tyball's maze.
string 5
What place does the key allow one to enter?
string 6
I thank thee.  What else canst thou tell me of the area?
string 7
Dost thou know why my magic powers have been drained?
string 8
I said, 'twas a key that allowed one to enter a secret place. There lies an item that permits one to pass through Tyball's maze. Wert thou not listening? The entrance is in the chasm of fire.

I will go kill the spider and get this key.

Dost thou know why my magic powers have been drained?

Wait! I have more information that may prove of use.
string 13
Well?
string 14
What information is this?
string 15
I need not thy help.  Farewell.
string 16
A mysterious Orb drains the magic from every living creature on this level.
string 17
And that why I cannot cast spells?
string 18
I thank thee for thy advice.  Farewell.
string 19
Indeed.  The Orb drains thy power and transfers it -- somewhere --  where it is put to some foul purpose.
string 20
Dost thou know who is behind this?
string 21
Farewell.
string 22
I know only that one mage, Tyball by name, seems immune to its effects.
string 23
The conclusion seems obvious.
string 24
I know this Tyball.  He is evil itself.
string 25
Indeed.  However, if thou dost wish to break the Orb's grasp on this area, best thou prepare thyself with means other than spells.
string 26
How can such a thing be accomplished?
string 27
Very well.  I thank thee.  Farewell.
string 28
All I can think is, if thou canst discover whence came the Orb, and obtain from its place of origin a fragment of its substance, thou mayst be able to destroy it with that.
string 29
This sounds an excellent idea!  But who knows whence it came?
string 30
I know not, but I think some friends of mine, who languish in prison, discovered its secret before they were captured by Tyball.  If thou canst talk to them, perhaps they can help thee.
string 31
Very well.  I thank thee for thy help.
string 32
I will go talk to them.
string 33
Good luck.
string 34
Thou art welcome.  Farewell.
string 35
Farewell.
string 36
Thou hast decided to talk to me after all?
string 37
Yes, what canst thou tell me of this area?
string 38
No, I think not.
string 39
I am sorry, but I have told thee all I can.  Perhaps my friends in the prisons can tell thee more of the Orb and the rocks made of the same substance.
string 40
I will talk to them.
string 41
Thank thee and farewell.

Greetings, friend.  I am Dantes.
string 2
Well met, Dantes.  How can I help thee?
string 3
Greetings, Dantes.  How wert thou captured?
string 4
I thank thee.  Perhaps I can help thee.  Thou doth seem to be in good health. Thou shouldst be able to make it over the lava.
string 5
What lava?
string 6
I dug myself an escape route from my cell, using only my belt-buckle. Unfortunately, the cell looks out on a lava-filled cavern, and I cannot make the leap.  I have a gamy leg, as thou can see.
string 7
Why didst thou come down here to begin with?
string 8
Perhaps I can carry thee.
string 9
I was a fool!  Rumor had it there were mysterious tombs down here, filled with fabulous treasures. I was searching for these when Tyball's lackeys got me...
string 10
Who is Tyball?
string 11
Where are these tombs?
string 12
I know naught but rumors. Some say those who find the tombs become permanent guests. It seems true in my case, at least.  But the treasure, the treasure is worth the risk...
string 13
That much treasure?
string 14
I thank thee.  Farewell.
string 15
Ah!  Tyball has not slain thee yet!  Thou art lucky!
string 16
What canst thou tell me of this Tyball?
string 17
Yes, I am.  Farewell, now.
string 18
I'm done for!  Thou... go on without me... I'll be all right. Go on, get!
string 19
I'll never make it!  Use the exit, and go!
string 20
Farewell, friend!  I'm a goner.  Get out while thou canst!
string 21
Oh, that much and more!  Why, I've heard tell of a knight who returned with a magical golden suit of armor. But alas, his mind was not the same, and one day he dove head-first into a pool of lava...
 In any event, thou must take care if thou doth enter the tombs.  First, though, use my escape route, and take care to jump over the rivers of lava.
string 22
What escape route?
string 23
Indeed.  My thanks for thy advice. Farewell.
string 24
Well, I wouldn't say no to something to eat.
string 25
Certainly.  Have some of my food.
string 26
I'm sorry, I haven't anything to eat.  How about some water?
string 27
I'm sorry to say I haven't any food or water.
string 28
That's plenty good for me!  I'm not long for this place, anyway.
string 29
Here thou art.
string 30
I'm sorry to say I haven't any food or water.
string 31
That is indeed a pity.  Thou wilt die soon without provisions.
string 32
Indeed. Surely someone of thy wisdom can help me?
string 33
An unpleasant observation, from one who is himself trapped.
string 34
I cannot believe thou hast not heard of him!  He is the most dangerous man in these parts, a sorcerer with powers that dwarf those of ordinary magicians the way the sun dwarfs a candle.
string 35
He is probably the one I'm after, then.
string 36
Oh, that Tyball.  Do not worry about him.
string 37
Thou must be crazy!  This Tyball is dangerous, I tell thee. Who dost thou think captured all these poor souls?
string 38
Enough of that!  He is my quarry.  What else canst thou tell me?
string 39
As thou sayst.  In any event, I must be going.  How can I leave?
string 40
I am confident I can defeat him.  Now I must be off.
string 41
Nay, it is impossible!  I am done for in any event.  Get out there and save thyself!
string 42
Very well.  I shall return for thee if I can.
string 43
As thou wish.  Good luck.
string 44
Where is the food thou didst promise?

I'm sorry, here it is.

string 38
Very well.
string 39
I shall do no such thing.
string 40
Swear, then!
string 41
I swear by my body and by my blood that I am no friend of Tyball's.
string 42
I swear by my sword that I mean Tyball no good!
string 43
I swear by all the virtues that Tyball and I are foes!
string 44
Very well.  Know then, that if ye be forsworn, all that ye hast sworn upon will turn against ye!
string 45
I have no fear. I stand by my oath.
string 46
I hereby recant and void my oath.
string 47
Here.  Take ye this splinter of crystal.
string 48
Ye seem heavily laden, so I'll leave it here for ye.
string 49
What is it?
string 50
I found it three days ago while at my labors in the mines. At night it makes a faint, eerie keening. I've heard rumors of others who've found its like, and before long they're off searching for the tombs from which it came.
string 51
Why give it to me?
string 52
I don't want it.
string 53
It will do thee no harm, and may even help thee.  I believe  it may give thee access to the tombs.
string 54
I told thee I don't want it.
string 55
Why should I enter the tombs?
string 56
I believe the tombs to be of my ancient ancestors, built here long before the colony of the Abyss was formed. I've dreamt of them since finding the crystal.
string 57
Again, why give this crystal to me?
string 58
And what lies in the tombs?
string 59
The way I figure it, the tombs have been defiled by an evil presence. This entity places the crystal where it'll be found, in order  to draw unwary souls to its lair. I ask ye - find these tombs and cleanse them of this evil, so that others do not fall into this trap.
string 60
And why should I do this?
string 61
I will do what I can.
string 62
If ye can do this, I'm sure the beast responsible will have collected a sizable hoard from his victims. Ye may find the items useful in your quest against Tyball. But beware - disturb not the tombs  themselves. Search for the entrance to the south of these prisons, where the pit trap spiders prowl.  Carry the crystal with ye in your search - it may prove to be helpful.
string 63
Thank thee, I will see if thy suppositions prove to be true.
string 64
I think imprisonment has addled thy brain. However, I will take the crystal just in case...
string 65
I make thee this offer.

Secret doors?  Who told thee of these secret doors?  Did he tell thee of the chasm of fire they lead to, as well?  It's becoming  impossible to keep a secret around here these days.

Don't worry, I can keep a secret.
string 16
The chasm of fire?  Why would I want to go to a chasm of fire?

I was captured while on a quest for the Key of Courage.
string 5
I also seek the Key.
string 6
That is too bad.  Didst thou achieve any success?
string 7
Indeed?  Then know this: I believe the entrance lies directly north of this very spot.
string 8
What else knowest thou of this entrance?
string 9
A locked door blocks the way. But I still have the key hidden here in my cell.  The key to the Key, as it were.
string 10
May I have this key?
string 11
Yes, for I have been imprisoned too long and have neither heart nor strength left for this quest.
string 12
It is thine.
string 13
I thank thee.
string 14
I am too weary to talk.
string 15
Go on, do what thou must.
string 16
Farewell, friend!  I shall leave here as soon as I rest a bit.
string 17
Nay, for even as I discovered the location of my objective, I was captured by Tyball.  He seemed to think I had been speaking with his deceased brother, ridiculous as that sounds.  He would not release me.  A pity, since I believed that the recovery of the three keys would help right the wrongs of this place.
string 18
If thou wilt entrust me with thy knowledge, I shall take up thy quest.
string 19
I shall set thee free and thou canst continue thy quest.
string 20
No, I cannot!  I am too weak now.  Would that thou could continue my quest for me!
string 21
I would be glad to.
string 22
Perhaps.
string 23
Of course!  I have not seen thee in the ranks of his lackeys.  How may I help thee?
string 24
Well, tell me what it is that hast brought thee here.
string 25
How may I help thee?
string 26
Nay, thou canst not help me!  My freedom is not restored by unlocking these bars, for I am in ill health and can no longer follow my quest: to find the Key of Courage.
string 27
Truly, then, I shall undertake to complete thy quest for thee.
string 28
Oh, well, never mind, then.
string 29
Please, thou must undertake to complete my quest.  Seek thou the Key of Courage.
string 30
Very well.  Where is it?
string 31
I make thee this offer.
string 32
I demand thou givest me these items.
string 33
Excuse me, I must think about this deal.

Who art thou?

Rest easy, now.  He is gone.
string 4
I am Gurstang. I ventured down here searching for the Key of Truth.
string 5
Gurstang? I met thy colleague Illomo. He is worried about thee.
string 6
I, too, seek the Key.
string 7
Illomo! So, Illomo told thee about me. Good, that means I  can trust thee. I think I've discovered the whereabouts of the key. Tell Illomo 'Folanae.' He'll know where to look, and explain what to do. As for myself, I have other matters to attend to down here. Farewell.
string 8
A noble quest, indeed, and one that should be fulfilled, even though I am no longer the man to do it.  Hmm.  I shall have to take a risk and trust thee. Seek out a man in the area of the Seers of the Moonstone.  His name is Illomo.  When thou dost meet him, tell him I recommend thee to him, and say this word: "Folanae." He will know what to do next.
string 9
Why, I thank thee.

I have better things to do than run thy errands!  Good-bye!

Who art thou?  Art thou here to take me back to the mines?  But no, thou art not one of them... Art thou here to rescue us, then?
string 2
No, I am trapped here myself, for the time being.
string 3
Of course.  But it may take a little while.
string 4
Ah, then, a prisoner like the rest of us...
string 5
Why art thou being held prisoner?
string 6
Only for the nonce.
string 7
Tyball keeps us here. To work the mines 'til we die... if we're lucky that is. Less fortunate ones he takes away to work his evil magicks on.
string 8
What dost thou mean by "evil magicks"?
string 9
I shall have to attend to this Tyball.
string 10
There are caverns to the east, filled with the dead. Victims of his  dark arts, gone awry. 'Tis said not even he dares venture there now.  But the dead things wait, taking their vengeance on any living thing  that enters.
string 11
Hmmm. Thou didst mention being forced to work the mines. Why?
string 12
Dost thou know what he attempts with his arts?
string 13
Who knows what we dig for? Mayhap materials he needs for his magic.  But it's been days now since I've worked the mines, after what we found on the lower level... And so few of us remain, left to rot in our cells.
string 14
The mines are below this level?
string 15
What heppened there?
string 16
We dug through to the level below this and hit a natural cavern. The walls were veined  with gold, but that's not what we were digging for, I'm sure. It was  here the fell beasts attacked us and killed most of us prisoners.
 The remaining few of us have been left here for days, with no food or  water. If thou couldst spare a morsel...
string 17
Certainly.  Eat thy fill.
string 18
Thank thee for thy help.
string 19
Oh, a hero, eh?  Ruddy great!  Won't Tyball have a time with thee!
string 20
What has this Tyball been doing?
string 21
Why, what dost thou mean?
string 22
Farewell, then, and good luck!
string 23
Farewell.
string 24
What I mean is that Tyball eats heroes the way a sailor eats limes!
string 25
Well, I trust he'll find me a sour morsel.
string 26
And what exactly has he been doing?
string 27
Many thanks!  Thou art a hero as far as I am concerned, just for sharing thy food!
string 28
Thou art most welcome.  Excuse me now, I must be going.
string 29
Hast thou no food for me?
string 30
Here is some.
string 31
I'm afraid not.
string 32
I am no sorcerer.  Whatever he attempts, though, it can mean no good!
string 33
Agreed.  Excuse me, I must go do what I can to thwart his plan.
string 34
I will be on my toes.

 Right from under the evil one's nose.
string 52
So why not just give me this crown?
string 53
I don't believe you. I'll just take whatever I want.

 My clues you must heed.
 Prove yourself worthy.
 And control your greed.

Why dost thou seek a demon? Art thou in league with it?
string 6
I plan to destroy this demon.
string 7
I am not in league, but why art thou here?
string 8
There are many bones down here. I do not intend to allow mine to join them.
string 9
I will not harm thee, but thou mayst be able to help me.
string 10
They shall if thou dost not tell me what I want to know!
string 11
And why art thou here?
string 12
I am on a quest. And why art thou residing in these fearsome depths?
string 13
Better I should ask thee. Art thou in league with the wizard, Tyball?
string 14
Ah, good luck to thee. I am not sure, but there is a large chamber in the center of the lava, guarded by many of the most fearsome creatures I have ever heard tell of.  I stole a key to the door which leads to the chamber's portal, but I fled for my life when I saw what was beyond.  I cannot say if there is a demon there.
string 15
Where is this door?
string 16
Please tell me more.
string 17
It is to the south, down the main hall. It is unmistakable, with devilish devices upon it. If thou dost wish to enter the door, I will give thee the key, as I do not intend to use it again!
string 18
Yes, that would be very helpful.
string 19
No, I will find another way and avoid the beasts.
string 20
I came to these depths on a quest to find the legendary gold mines. While I was exploring, an evil magic was done, and I became trapped here, my return blocked by a powerful wizard.
 I have been here for weeks now, trying to survive and find another way home. I have had almost no food, as the creatures I have killed are too foul to eat.
string 21
The way home is open for thee now. Leave now!
string 22
Here is some food. Wilt thou tell me more of thy exploring?
string 23
Here is the key. If thou'rt smarter than brave, thou wilt not use it, but wilt make thy escape with me.
string 24
I will leave it for you here.
string 25
I must finish my quest. But why dost thou stay here?
string 26
I may or may not find use for it. Thank thee, I must make haste.
string 27
The only way I have seen is across the lava, and if thou dost not burn from the heat, there are fearsome creatures of fire dwelling there!
string 28
I may be able to cross nonetheless. Canst thou tell me anything more?
string 29
I shall cross regardless. Thank thee for thy help.
string 30
Hah! I have faced worse threats than thee in these depths. Prepare thyself!
string 31
I apologize for my harshness. Please tell me about thy journey.
string 32
Die then, foolish one!
string 33
I am sorry. I will leave thee in peace.
string 34
I know no such person. I know only that I am trapped here by a wizard.
string 35
How didst thou come to be trapped?
string 36
Then I will take my leave before I am trapped as well.
string 37
Fear not, the wizard is dead. I will leave thee to make thy escape.
string 38
Thou art toying with me most cruelly! Leave me!
string 39
But thou art empty-handed! Dost thou truly wish to give me some food?
string 40
Yes, I'm sorry, here it is...
string 41
No, I have no food to give thee.
string 42
I thank thee kindly.  May thy quest come to a happier end than mine!
string 43
I thank thee most kindly. Here, I found this wand with some bones far to the southwest of here.  I believe that the bones were those of a great wizard. They were near a Knight's remains. There was more, but I had to flee a fearsome stone creature before I could gather it up.
string 44
Thank thee.  I will be on my way now.
string 45
Well, leave me then, as I must rest before I make another attempt at escape.
string 46
Goodbye, then.
string 47
Hello again.
string 48
Canst thou tell me about thyself?
string 49
Canst thou tell me where the key to the door to the demon is?
string 50
I have some food for thee.
string 51
It is good to see thee again, but farewell for now.

string 1
So, another comrade is caught by the Abyss!  What was thy crime, pray-tell?
string 2
I committed no crime.
string 3
I have always lived here as a peaceful fisherman.
string 4
I am accused of kidnapping a girl.
string 5
Hm, perhaps the same girl that I hear was carried through these upper caves by a Troll.
string 6
Yes, that must be the one!
string 7
Perhaps it was another.
string 8
Where did he take her?
string 9
Well, whoever she was, she's here no longer.  I don't know how far the Troll was planning on taking her, but given the strength of a Troll, he'll not likely run out of energy any time soon.
string 10
I must be off immediately!
string 11
Then there is no hope of rescuing her.
string 12
Hold on just a minute.  Surely that girl is in trouble, but if thou dost learn the ways of the Abyss first, thou wilt surely have a better chance of rescuing her.
string 13
And what should I know of the Abyss?
string 14
Just tell me what areas I should stay clear of.
string 15
Well, thou shouldst know that most of the inhabitants of the Abyss are unfriendly.  It's not so much a question of what areas to avoid as of which areas are relatively safe.
 Look for the Banner of Cabirus -- a tapestry with an ankh, such as we have -- as a sign of civilization.  Any people or creatures thou dost find past the Banner are more likely to talk with thee than eat thee.
 Speaking of ankhs, thou wouldst do well to search out the other thing they represent: the shrines.
string 16
What use do they serve?
string 17
Where can I find them?
string 18
When thou dost see a large, plain ankh standing on the ground, thou hast found a shrine to Virtue.
 It is said that if thou hast been virtuous, and dedicated to increasing thy abilities, praying at a shrine with the correct mantra will allow thee to enhance thy abilities.
 It is said that there is one in the southeast area of these upper caves, but I have not seen it myself.
string 19
I thank thee for thy information.
string 20
Now I must be off to use the advice thou hast given me.
string 21
Well, good luck in thy travels.  Thou art always welcome here.
string 22
Oh, thou art an innocent passerby, eh?  Perhaps thou art here on a tour of the Abyss?  Or art thou a census taker? A tax collector?  Eh?
string 23
I was thrown here wrongfully, and seek freedom.
string 24
Yes, I am simply touring these caves.
string 25
I was commissioned by Baron Almric to map the Abyss.
string 26
Already been driven mad, I see.  'Tis a pity, truly, to see the mind go on one so young.  Ah, well, death is probably thy best hope. Good luck.
string 27
Thrown here against thy will I will believe, but wrongfully is a different matter.  No need to pretend amoungst us, though.  Not a one of us believes in Almric's petty justice.
  Now that thou'rt here, thou shouldst stay with us.  The creatures beyond are far worse than anything Almric could do to thee.  Right here near the door is safest.  Trust me.
string 28
What is out there that is so bad?
string 29
Dost thou ever venture outside?
string 30
'Tis unbelievable. Once, it is said, all the races here lived in harmony.  Not now, that's for certain.  The Gobs on this level are constantly at war, with each other as well as everyone else.  And below are things I dare not speak of.
 'Tis rumored that some remnants of civilization remain in most colonized areas of the Abyss, but I have never had the courage or interest to find out.
string 31
How can I find whatever civilization remains?
string 32
Dost thou have any advice for survival?
string 33
A hearty welcome to thee.  Hast thou decided to stay with us?
string 34
No, my destiny lies elsewhere.
string 35
Perhaps for a while.
string 36
I am glad to hear it.  This is by far the safest place in the Abyss.
string 37
I think not, but I would like any advice thou canst give me.
string 38
What wouldst thou know of?
string 39
Hast thou news of a kidnapped girl?
string 40
What is life like up here?
string 41
What inhabitants should I avoid?

What you doing here?
string 3
Canst thou tell me any news?

I am searching for trolls to kill.
string 5
I am merely exploring.
string 6
We trade?
string 7
Yes.
string 8
No.
string 9
I have no new news for you.
string 10
Me hear one Troll got caught by Wizard, made slave.
string 11
Me hear somebody killing Trolls!  Me catch, me eat!
string 12
Sethar and his friend live near the big pit.
string 13
Sneak snuck on Sethar, but he tossed him in pit.
string 14
One Knight real mean, he live up north.
string 15
Ghouls live below us.  They disgusting.

You food, puny human?

Yes, come and get it...

No, let's not fight.

Ha!  Try it!

You confuse me, first want fight and then not want fight.

I make thee this offer.

Excuse me, I must think about this deal.

I do not wish to barter any further.

Farewell.

I accept thy offer.
string 27
No, I do not like this deal.
string 28
Dost thou take me for a fool?
string 29
I am weary of this haggling.
string 30
Surely thou art joking.
string 31
Dost thou intend to rob me?
string 32
Yes, I must.
string 33
No, thou dost misunderstand me.
string 34
If thou dost insist, thou canst have them.
string 35
No! Thou shalt not take them!

A human it is.  We have been watching you.  A fine race you are, but somewhat unknowledgable.  To divide all your intelligence amongst yourselves as you do - it does not seem correct.  And your bodies must be so hard to maintain.  Still, we are impressed that you do as well as you do.
string 2
Do you not miss having bodies?
string 3
Is it not equally difficult to consist only of globes of light?
string 4
Surely it is not so.  Having no bodies to hamper us, we have no worries or cares.  We can devote our whole being to our sole quest - the gathering of information.
string 5
And what information have you gathered?
string 6
I must know very little compared to you.
string 7
Indeed, most of the things we know are on such a high plane that it is doubtful a human would be able to understand them.
string 8
I doubt it.
string 9
Such as what?
string 10
Ah, so you would know information so advanced it is more dangerous than you can imagine?  Very well, here is a piece for you: the spell Vas Kal Corp will bring an end to life as you know it, although higher beings such as we will continue to exist in our own way.  There.  We are eager to see to what use you will put this information.
string 11
Thank thee.  I will try it out.
string 12
Perhaps you are not as intelligent as we first thought.
string 13
This information is useless to me.
string 14
And that itself is something it is good you should know.
string 15
So you have decided not to use the information we have given you?
string 16
Yes.  It is too dangerous.
string 17
If you have learned that not all information is beneficial, you have indeed learned some beneficial information.
string 18
I will shortly.
string 19
Indeed!  That will be an interesting sight.
